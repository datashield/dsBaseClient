About
=====

DataSHIELD is a software package which allows you to do non-disclosive federated analysis on sensitive data. Our website (https://www.datashield.org) has in depth descriptions of what it is, how it works and how to install it. A key point to highlight is that DataSHIELD has a client-server infrastructure, so the dsBase package (https://github.com/datashield/dsBase) needs to be used in conjuction with the dsBaseClient package (https://github.com/datashield/dsBaseClient) - trying to use one without the other makes no sense.

Detailed instructions on how to install DataSHIELD are at https://www.datashield.org/wiki.

Discussion and help with using DataSHIELD can be obtained from The DataSHIELD Forum https://datashield.discourse.group/

\title{Generates the summary of an object}
\usage{
ds.summary(x = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric or factor variable}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
the returned information depends on the class of the objects.
}
\description{
Provides some insight about an object. Unlike the similar R function
only a limited class of objects can be used as input to reduce the risk of disclosure.
}
\details{
The class and size of the object are returned and various other information are 
also returned depending of the class of the object. Potentially disclosive information
such as the minimum and maximum values of numeric vectors are not returned. The summary 
is given for each study separately.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load the login data
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign all the variable held in the opal database
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE)

  # Example 1: suummary of a numerical variable
  ds.summary(x='D$LAB_TSC')

  # Example 1: suummary of a binary variable
  ds.summary(x='D$GENDER')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

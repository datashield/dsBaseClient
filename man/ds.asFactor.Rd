\usage{
ds.asFactor(
  input.var.name = NULL,
  newobj.name = NULL,
  forced.factor.levels = NULL,
  fixed.dummy.vars = FALSE,
  baseline.level = 1,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.var.name}{a character string which provides 
the name of the variable to be converted to a factor.}

\item{newobj.name}{a character string that provides the name for the output variable 
that is stored on the data servers. Default \code{asfactor.newobj}.}

\item{forced.factor.levels}{the levels that the user wants to split the input variable. 
If NULL (default) a vector with all unique levels from all studies are created.}

\item{fixed.dummy.vars}{boolean. If TRUE the input variable is converted to a factor 
but presented as a matrix of dummy variables. 
If FALSE (default) the input variable
is converted to a factor and assigned as a vector.}

\item{baseline.level}{an integer indicating the baseline level 
to be used in the creation of the matrix with dummy variables. 
If the \code{fixed.dummy.vars} is set to FALSE then any value of the baseline level is not taken
into account.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. 
If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.asFactor} returns the unique levels of the converted 
variable in ascending order and a validity 
message with the name of the created object on the client-side and 
the output matrix or vector in the server-side.
}
\description{
This function assigns a server-side numeric vector into a factor type.
}
\details{
Converts a numeric vector into a factor type which is represented either as a vector
or as a matrix of dummy variables depending on the argument \code{fixed.dummy.vars}.
The matrix of dummy variables also depends on the argument
\code{baseline.level}. 

To understand how the matrix of the dummy variable is created let's assume that we have the vector
\code{(1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 3, 4, 5)} of ten integer numbers. 
If we set the argument \code{fixed.dummy.vars = TRUE},
\code{baseline.level = 1} and \code{forced.factor.levels = c(1,2,3,4,5)}. 
The input vector is converted to the following matrix of dummy variables: 

\tabular{rrrrr}{
  \strong{DV2} \tab \strong{DV3} \tab \strong{DV4} \tab \strong{DV5} \cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  0  \tab  0\cr
    1   \tab  0  \tab  0  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  0  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  1  \tab  0  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  1  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  1  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  0  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  1  \tab  0  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  1  \tab  0\cr
    0   \tab  0  \tab  0  \tab  1  
}

 For the same example if the \code{baseline.level = 3} then the matrix is: 
 
 \tabular{rrrr}{
   \strong{DV1} \tab \strong{DV2} \tab \strong{DV4} \tab \strong{DV5}  \cr
    1 \tab  0 \tab  0 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  1 \tab  0 \tab  0\cr
    1 \tab  0 \tab  0 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  0 \tab  0 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  0 \tab  1 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  0 \tab  1 \tab  0\cr
    1 \tab  0 \tab  0 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  0 \tab  0 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  0 \tab  1 \tab  0\cr
    0 \tab  0 \tab  0 \tab  1  
}

In the first instance the first row of the matrix has zeros in all entries indicating 
that the first data point belongs to level 1 (as the baseline level is equal to 1). 
The second row has 1 at the first (\code{DV2}) column and zeros elsewhere,
indicating that the second data point belongs to level 2. 
In the second instance (second matrix) where the baseline level is equal to 3, 
the first row of the matrix has 1 at the
first (\code{DV1}) column and zeros elsewhere, 
indicating again that the first data point belongs to level 1.
Also as we can see the fourth row of the second matrix has all its elements equal 
to zero indicating that the
fourth data point belongs to level 3 (as the baseline level, in that case, is 3).

If the \code{baseline.level} is set to be equal to a value 
that is not one of the levels of the factor then a
matrix of dummy variables is created having as many columns as the number of levels.
In that case in each row there is a unique entry equal to 1 at a 
certain column indicating the level of each data point. So, for the
above example where the vector has five levels
if we set the \code{baseline.level} equal to a value that does not
belong to those five levels (\code{baseline.level=8}) 
the matrix of dummy variables is:
 
\tabular{rrrrr}{
       \strong{DV1}  \tab \strong{DV2} \tab \strong{DV3} \tab \strong{DV4} \tab \strong{DV5}\cr
        1   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 0   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  1  \tab 0   \tab 0   \tab 0\cr
        1   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 0   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  0  \tab 1   \tab 0   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 1   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 1   \tab 0\cr
        1   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 0   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  0  \tab 1   \tab 0   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 1   \tab 0\cr
        0   \tab  0  \tab 0   \tab 0   \tab 1

\title{Turns a numeric vector into factor type}
\usage{
ds.asFactor(x = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of numeric, integer or character vector}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new vector.If this argument is set to NULL, the name of the new 
variable is the name of the input variable with the suffixe '_fact'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.
By default an internal function looks for 'opal' objects in the environment and sets this parameter.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned to the client, the new object is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{as.factor} but it does not allow users
to create factors where a categorie has less than two observations.
}
\details{
Unlike the R function 'as.factor' vectors where some levels have less than 2 observations
are not allow, an empty vector (i.e. all values within it are set to NA) is then generated.
}
\examples{
{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)
  library(opal)

  # login and assign specific variable(s)
  # (by default the assigned dataset is a dataframe named 'D')
  myvar <- list('GENDER', 'LAB_HDL')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # turn the factor variable 'GENDER' into numeric and then back into factor
  ds.asNumeric(x='D$GENDER', newobj='gender_num')
  ds.asFactor(x='gender_num', newobj='gender_fact')

  # Now try to turn into a factor a numeric variable where some levels have less
  # than 2 observations (as you would expect for a continuous variable)
  # this will generate a vector missing at complte (i.e. all values within it are set to NA).
  ds.asFactor(x='D$LAB_HDL', newobj='lab.hdl.fact')
  # check the levels of the new vector
  ds.levels(x='lab.hdl.fact')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

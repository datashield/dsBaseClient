\title{ds.rm calling aggregate function rmDS}
\usage{
ds.rm(x.name = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name, }{the name of the object to be deleted specified in
inverted commas. For example: x.name='object.name'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
the specified object is deleted from the serverside. If this
is successful the message "Object <x.name> successfully deleted" is returned
to the clientside (where x.name is the name of the object to be deleted).
If the object to be deleted is already absent on a given
source, that source will return the message: "Object to be deleted, i.e. <x.name> ,
does not exist so does not need deleting". Finally, if the specified name
of the object to be deleted is too long (>nfilter.stringShort) there is
a potential disclosure risk (active code hidden in the name) and the
serverside function returns a message such as: "Disclosure risk, number of characters
in x.name must not exceed nfilter.stringShort which is currently set at: 25" where
'25' is the current setting of the R_Option value of nfilter.stringShort.

\description{
deletes an R object on the serverside
}
\details{
this clientside function calls a serverside function
based on the rm() function in native R. This is the
aggregate function rmDS. The fact that it is an aggregate
function maybe surprising because it modifies an object
on the serverside, and would therefore be expected to be an assign function.
However, as an assign function the last step in running it
would be to write the modified object as newobj. But this would
fail because the effect of the function is to delete the object and so
it would be impossible to write it anywhere. Please note that although
this calls an aggregate function there is no <type> argument.

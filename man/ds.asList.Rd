\title{Constructs an object of type list}
\usage{
ds.asList(x = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of the object to convert into a list}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new vector.If this argument is set to NULL, the name of the new
variable is the name of the input variable with the suffixe '_list'}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.
By default an internal function looks for 'opal' objects in the environment and sets this parameter.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned to the client, the new object is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{as.list} with some restrictions.
}
\details{


Unlike the R function 'as.list' only certain object types (data.frame, matrix) can be turned
into a list, this is because turning a single vector into a list produces a list where each element
holds one value only. A matrix is turned into data.frame before being converted into a list.
When a data.frame, matrix is turned into a list the output list is allowed only if the number of rows
of the input data.frame or matrix is greater than the allowed number of observations. Otherwise
a list missing at complete is generated (i.e. all elements set to NA)).

\examples{
{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign all the stored variable(s)
  # (by default the assigned dataset is a dataframe named 'D')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE)

  # turn the dataframe 'D' (the default name of the dataframe assign above) into a list
  ds.asList(x='D')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

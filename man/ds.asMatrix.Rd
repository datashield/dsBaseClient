\alias{ds.asMatrix}
\title{Attempts to turn its argument into a matrix}
\usage{
ds.asMatrix(x = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of the an object to conver to a matrix.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new vector.If this argument is set to \code{NULL}, the name of the new 
variable is the name of the input variable with the suffixe '_matrix'}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.
By default an internal function looks for 'opal' objects in the environment and sets this parameter.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned to the client, the new object is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{as.matrix}.
}
\details{
Unlike the R function 'as.matrix' the output matrix is generated only if the input matrix
is valid (i.e. has a number of rows greater than the minimal number of observations allowed).
}
\examples{
{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)
  library(opal)

  # login and assign all the stored variable(s)
  # (by default the assigned dataset is a dataframe named 'D')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE)

  # turn the data frame 'D' (default name of the dataframe assigned above) into a matrix
  ds.asMatrix(x='D')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

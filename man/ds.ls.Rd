\alias{ds.ls}
\title{Returns a vector of character strings giving the names of the objects on remote server}
\usage{
ds.ls(datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
a vector of character strings giving the names of the objects in the 'current'
environment of the remote data repository server.
}
\description{
this function is similar to R function \code{ls}
}
\details{
When running analyses one may want to know the objects already generated. This
function is not disclosive as it only returns the names of the objects and not their contents.
As a restriction only objects in the current environment can be displayed and hidden objects
names (names starting with '.') cannot be returned to avoid displaying anything else than
the objects generated by the user in the current environment. Unlike the R base version of
this function, the DataSHIELD version does not allow to specify another environment, only
names of objects on the 'current' environment can be displayed.

\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load the file that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign the required variables to R
  myvar <- list("LAB_TSC")
  conns <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # assign 'LAB_TSC' in the dataframe D to a new variable 'labtsc'
  ds.assign(toAssign='D$LAB_TSC', newobj='labtsc')

  # now call the ds.ls function to display the names of the objects on the server site
  ds.ls()

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(conns)

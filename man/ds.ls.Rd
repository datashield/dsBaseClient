\title{lists all objects on a server-side environment}
\usage{
ds.ls(
  search.filter = NULL,
  env.to.search = 1L,
  search.GlobalEnv = TRUE,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{search.filter}{character string (potentially including \code{*} symbol) specifying the filter 
for the object name that you want to find in the enviroment. For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{env.to.search}{an integer (e.g. in \code{2} or \code{2L} format) specifying the position
in the search path of the environment to be explored. \code{1L} is the current active analytic
environment on the server-side and is the default value of \code{env.to.search}.
For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{search.GlobalEnv}{Logical. If TRUE, \code{ds.ls} will list all objects
in the \code{.GlobalEnv} R environment on the server-side. If FALSE and if \code{env.to.search} is also
set as a valid integer, \code{ds.ls} will list all objects in the server-side R environment
identified by \code{env.to.search} in the search path. 
For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} 
objects obtained after login. If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.ls} returns to the client-side a list containing: \cr
(1) the name/details of the server-side R environment which \code{ds.ls} has searched;\cr
(2) a vector of character strings giving the names of
all objects meeting the naming criteria specified by the argument \code{search.filter} in this
specified R server-side environment;\cr
(3) the nature of the search filter string as it was applied.
}
\description{
creates a list of the names of all of the objects in
a specified serverside environment.
}
\details{
When running analyses one may want to know the objects already generated. This 
request is not disclosive as it only returns the names of the objects and not their contents. 

By default, objects in DataSHIELD's Active Serverside Analytic Environment (\code{.GlobalEnv})
will be listed. This is the environment that contains all of the objects that server-side DataSHIELD 
is using for the main analysis or has written out to the server-side during the process
of managing or undertaking the analysis (variables, scalars, matrices, data frames, etc).
 
The environment to explore is specified by the argument \code{env.to.search} (i.e. environment
to search) to an integer value. The default environment 
which R names as \code{.GlobalEnv} is set by specifying \code{env.to.search = 1} or \code{1L}
(\code{1L} is just an explicit way of writing the integer \code{1}). 

If the \code{search.GlobalEnv} argument is set to TRUE the \code{env.to.search} parameter  
is set to \code{1L} regardless of what value it is set in the call
or if it is set to NULL. 
So, if \code{search.GlobalEnv} is set to TRUE, \code{ds.ls} will automatically
search the \code{.GlobalEnv} R environment on the server-side which contains all of the
variables, data frames and other objects read in at the start of the analysis,
as well as any new objects of any sort created using DataSHIELD assign functions. 

Other server-side environments contain other
objects. For example, environment \code{2L} contains the functions loaded via the native R
stats package and \code{6L} contains the standard list of datasets built into R. By default
\code{ds.ls} will return a list of ALL of the objects in the environment specified by the
\code{env.to.search} argument but you can specify search filters including \code{*} wildcards
using the \code{search.filter} argument.

In \code{search.filter} you can use the symbol \code{*} to find all the object that contains
the specified characters. For example, \code{search.filter = "Sd2*"} 
will list the names of all objects in the specified
environment with names beginning capital S, lower case d and number 2. 
Similarly, \code{search.filter="*.ID"} will return all objects with names ending with \code{.ID},
for example \code{Study.ID}. 
If a value is not specified for the \code{search.filter} argument or it is set as NULL, the names of 
all objects in the specified environment will be returned.

Server function called: \code{lsDS}.

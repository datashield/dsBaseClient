\alias{ds.length.o}
\title{Gets the length of a vector or list}
\usage{
ds.length.o(x = NULL, type = "both", checks = "FALSE",
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a string character, the name of a vector or list}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. 
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', 'combined', 'combines' or 'c', a global length is returned 
if \code{type} is set to 'split', 'splits' or 's', the length is returned separately for each study.
if \code{type} is set to 'both' or 'b', both sets of outputs are produced}

\item{checks}{a Boolean indicator of whether to undertake optional checks of model
components. Defaults to checks=FALSE to save time. It is suggested that checks
should only be undertaken once the function call has failed}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal
servers; these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe},
from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
a numeric, the length of the input vector or list.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{length}.
}
\details{
The function returns the pooled length of the a vector or a list, 
or the length of the a vector or a list for each study separately.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign all the variables stored on the server side
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata, assign=TRUE)

  # Example 1: Get the total number of observations of the vector of
  # variable 'LAB_TSC' across all the studies 
  ds.length(x='D$LAB_TSC', type='combine')

  # Example 2: Get the number of observations of the vector of variable
  # 'LAB_TSC' for each study separately
  ds.length(x='D$LAB_TSC', type='split')

  # Example 3: Get the number of observations on each study and the total
  # number of observations across all the studies for the variable 'LAB_TSC'
  ds.length(x='D$LAB_TSC', type='both')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

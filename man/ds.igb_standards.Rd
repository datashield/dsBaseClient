\usage{
ds.igb_standards(
  gagebrth = NULL,
  z = 0,
  p = 50,
  val = NULL,
  var = NULL,
  sex = NULL,
  fun = "igb_value2zscore",
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gagebrth}{the name of the "gestational age at birth in days" variable.}

\item{z}{z-score(s) to convert (must be between 0 and 1). Default value is 0.
This value is used only if \code{fun} is set to "igb_zscore2value".}

\item{p}{centile(s) to convert (must be between 0 and 100). Default value is p=50. 
This value is used only if \code{fun} is set to "igb_centile2value".}

\item{val}{the name of the anthropometric variable to convert.}

\item{var}{the name of the measurement to convert ("lencm", "wtkg", "hcircm", "wlr").}

\item{sex}{the name of the sex factor variable. The variable should be coded as Male/Female.
If it is coded differently (e.g. 0/1), then you can use the ds.recodeValues function to 
recode the categories to Male/Female before the use of ds.igb_standards.}

\item{fun}{the name of the function to be used. This can be one of: "igb_centile2value",
"igb_zscore2value", "igb_value2zscore" (default), "igb_value2centile".}

\item{newobj}{a character string that provides the name for the output variable
that is stored on the data servers. Default name is set to \code{igb.newobj}.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link[DSI]{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. 
If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified the default set of connections will be
used: see \code{\link[DSI]{datashield.connections_default}}.}

assigns the converted measurement as a new object on the server-side

Converts birth measurements to INTERGROWTH z-scores/centiles (generic)
}
\note{
For gestational ages between 24 and 33 weeks, the INTERGROWTH very early preterm 
standard is used.

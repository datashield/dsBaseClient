\title{ds.matrixTranspose calling assign function matrixTransposeDS}
\usage{
ds.matrixTranspose(M1 = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix to be transposed}

\item{newobj}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix to which the output
is to be written. If no <newobj> argument is specified, the output matrix names defaults
to "matrixtranspose.newobj"}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or default name <M1>_transposed)
which is written to the serverside. In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.matrixInvert also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message}
function. If you type ds.message("newobj") it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message("newobj")
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".
}
\description{
Transposes a matrix A and writes the output to the serverside
}
\details{
Undertakes standard matrix transposition. This operation converts matrix
A to matrix C where element C[i,j] of matrix C equals element A[j,i] of matrix
A. Matrix A therefore has the same number of rows as matrix C has columns and
vice versa.

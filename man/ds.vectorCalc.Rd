\title{Performs a mathematical operation on two or more vectors}
\usage{
ds.vectorCalc(x = NULL, calc = NULL, newobj = "math_output",
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of characters, the names of the vectors to include in the operation.}

\item{calc}{a character, a symbol that indicates the mathematical operation to carry out:
'+' for addition, '/' for division, *' for multiplication and '-' for subtraction.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the output object. By default the name is 'vectorCalc_output'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
no data are returned to user, the output vector is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
Carries out a row-wise operation on two or more vector. The function calls no
server side function; it uses the R operation symbols built in DataSHIELD.
}
\details{


In DataSHIELD it is possible to perform an operation on vectors by just using the relevant
R symbols (e.g. '+' for addtion, '*' for multiplication, '-' for substraction and '/' for division).
This might however be inconvenient if the number of vectors to include in the operation is large.
This function takes the names of two or more vectors and performs the desired operation which could be
an addition, a multiplication, a substraction or a division. If one or more vectors have a missing value
at any one entry (i.e. observation), the operation returns a missing value ('NA') for that entry; the output
vectors has, hence the same length as the input vectors.

  # load the file that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign the required variables to R
  myvar <- list('LAB_TSC','LAB_HDL')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # performs an addtion of 'LAB_TSC' and 'LAB_HDL'
  myvectors <- c('D$LAB_TSC', 'D$LAB_HDL')
  ds.vectorCalc(x=myvectors, calc='+')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

\title{Generates a table for pooled results}
\usage{
meanByClassHelper2(dtsources, tablenames, variables, invalidrecorder)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtsources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}

\item{tablenames}{a character vector, the name of the subset tables}

\item{variables}{a character vector, the names of the continuous variables to computes a mean for.}

\item{invalidrecorder}{a list, holds informations about invalid subsets in each study.}
}
\value{
a matrix, a table which contains the length, mean and standard deviation of each of the
specified 'variables' in each subset table.
}
\description{
This is an internal function.
}
\details{
This function is called by the function 'ds.meanByClass' to produce the final table
if the user sets the parmater 'type' to combine (the default behaviour of 'ds.meanByClass')

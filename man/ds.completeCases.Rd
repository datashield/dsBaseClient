\title{Identifies complete cases in server-side R objects}
\usage{
ds.completeCases(x1 = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{a character denoting the name of the input object which can be a data frame,
matrix or vector.}

\item{newobj}{a character string that provides the name for the complete-cases object
that is stored on the data servers. If the user does not specify a name, then the function 
generates a name for the generated object that is the name of the input object with the 
suffix "_complete.cases"}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. 
If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified, the default set of connections will be
used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.completeCases} generates a modified data frame, matrix or vector from which
all rows containing at least one NA have been deleted. The output object is stored on the
server-side. Only two validity messages are returned to the client-side indicating the name
of the \code{newobj} that has been created in each data source and if it is in a valid form.
}
\description{
Selects complete cases of a data frame,
matrix or vector that contain missing values.
}
\details{
In the case of a data frame or matrix, \code{ds.completeCases} deletes 
all rows containing one or more missing values. However \code{ds.completeCases} 
in vectors only deletes the observation recorded as NA.  

Server function called: \code{completeCasesDS}

\title{Runs the computation if variables are within a table structure}
\usage{
meanByClassHelper0b(x, outvar, covar, type, datasources)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of the dataset to get the subsets from.}

\item{outvar}{a character vector, the names of the continuous variables}

\item{covar}{a character vector, the names of up to 3 categorical variables}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. If \code{type} is set to
'combine', a pooled table of results is generated. If \code{type} is set to 'split', a table of results
is generated for each study.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link[DSI]{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link[DSI]{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
a table or a list of tables that hold the length of the numeric variable(s) and their mean
and standard deviation in each subgroup (subset).
}
\description{
This is an internal function.
}
\details{
This function is called by the function 'ds.meanByClass' to produce the final tables
if the user specify a table structure.

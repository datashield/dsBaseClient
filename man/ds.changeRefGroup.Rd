\title{Changes the reference level of a factor in the server-side}
\usage{
ds.changeRefGroup(
  x = NULL,
  ref = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  reorderByRef = FALSE,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character string providing the name of the input vector of type factor.}

\item{ref}{the reference level.}

\item{newobj}{a character string that provides the name for the output object
that is stored on the server-side. Default \code{changerefgroup.newobj}.}

\item{reorderByRef}{logical, if TRUE the new vector
should be ordered by the reference group (i.e. putting the reference group first).
The default is to not re-order (see the reasons in the details).}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. 
If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.changeRefGroup} returns a new vector  with the specified level as a reference
which is written to the server-side.
}
\description{
Change the reference level of a factor, by putting 
the reference group first.  

This function is similar to R function \code{relevel}.
}
\details{
This function
allows the user to re-order the vector, putting the reference
group first. It should be mentioned that by default the reference is 
the first level in the vector of levels.  
If the user chooses the re-order a warning is issued
as this can introduce a mismatch of values if the vector is put back
into a table that is not reordered in the same way. Such mismatch
can render the results of operations on that table invalid.

Server function called: \code{changeRefGroupDS}

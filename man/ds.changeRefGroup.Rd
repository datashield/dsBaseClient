\title{Changes the reference level of a factor}
\usage{
ds.changeRefGroup(x = NULL, ref = NULL, newobj = NULL,
  reorderByRef = FALSE, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of a vector of type factor.}

\item{ref}{the reference level}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new variable. If this argument is set to NULL, 
the name of the new variable is the name of the input variable with the 
suffixe '_newref'.}

\item{reorderByRef}{a boolean that tells whether or not the new vector 
should be ordered by the reference group (i.e. putting the reference group first).
The default is to not re-order for the reasons explained in the 'details' section.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned to the client, the new object is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{relevel}.
}
\details{
In addition to what the R function does, this function
allows for the user to re-order the vector, putting the reference
group first. If the user chooses the re-order a warning is issued 
as this can introduce a mismatch of values if the vector is put back
into a table that is not reordered in the same way. Such mismatch
can render the results of operations on that table invalid.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign all the stored variables
  # (by default the assigned dataset is a dataframe named 'D')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE)

  # Example 1: rename the categories and change the reference with re-ordering
  # print out the levels of the initial vector
  ds.levels(x='D$PM_BMI_CATEGORICAL')

  # define a vector with the new levels and recode the initial levels
  newNames <- c('normal', 'overweight', 'obesity')
  ds.recodeLevels(x='D$PM_BMI_CATEGORICAL', newCategories=newNames, newobj='bmi_new')

  # print out the levels of the new vector
  ds.levels(x='bmi_new')

  # by default the reference is the first level in the vector of levels (here 'normal')
  # now change and set the reference to 'obesity' without changing the order (default)
  ds.changeRefGroup(x='bmi_new', ref='obesity', newobj='bmi_ob')

  # print out the levels; the first listed level (i.e. the reference) is now 'obesity'
  ds.levels(x='bmi_ob')

  # Example 2: change the reference and re-order by the refence level
  # If re-ordering is sought, the action is completed but a warning is issued.
  ds.recodeLevels(x='D$PM_BMI_CATEGORICAL', newCategories=newNames, newobj='bmi_new')
  ds.changeRefGroup(x='bmi_new', ref='obesity', newobj='bmi_ob', reorderByRef=TRUE)

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

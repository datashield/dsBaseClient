\title{ds.matrixMult calling assign function matrixMultDS}
\usage{
ds.matrixMult(M1 = NULL, M2 = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1}{A character string specifying the name of the first matrix (M1)}

\item{M2}{A character string specifying the name of the second matrix (M2)}

\item{newobj}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix to which the output
is to be written. If no <newobj> argument is specified, the output matrix names defaults
to "matrixmult.newobj"}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or default name <M1>_<M2>)
which is written to the serverside. In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.matrixMult also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message}
function. If you type ds.message("newobj") it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message("newobj")
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

\description{
Calculates the matrix product of two matrices and writes output to serverside
}
\details{
Undertakes standard matrix multiplication where with input matrices A and B with
dimensions A: mxn and B: nxp the output C has dimensions mxp and each elemnt C[i,j] has
value equal to the dot product of row i of A and column j of B where the dot product
is obtained as sum(A[i,1]*B[1,j] + A[i,2]*B[2,j] + .... + A[i,n]*B[n,j]). This calculation
is only valid if the number of columns of A is the same as the number of rows of B

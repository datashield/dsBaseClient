\title{Generates a density grid with or without a priori defined limits}
\usage{
ds.densityGrid(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  numints = 20,
  type = "combine",
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character the name of numerical vector}

\item{y}{a character the name of numerical vector}

\item{numints}{an integer, the number of intervals for the grid density object, by default is 20.}

\item{type}{a character which represent the type of graph to display. If \code{type} is set to
'combine', a pooled grid density matrix is generated and one grid density matrix is generated
for each study if \code{type} is set to 'split'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
a grid density matrix is returned
}
\description{
This function generates a grid density object which can then be used to produced
heatmap or contour plots. The cells with a count > 0 and < nfilter.tab are considered invalid
and the count is set to 0. The function prints the number of invalid cells in for participating
study.
}
\details{
In DataSHIELD the user does not have access to the micro-data so and extreme values
such as the maximum and the minimum are potentially disclosive so this function does not allow
for the user to set the limits of the density grid and the minimum and maximum values of the x
and y vectors. These elements are set by the server side function \code{densityGridDS} to
'valid' values (i.e. values that do not lead to leakage of micro-data to the user).

\dontrun{

  # load the file that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign the required variables to R
  myvar <- list("LAB_TSC","LAB_HDL")
  conns <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # Example1: generate a combined grid density object (the default behaviour)
  ds.densityGrid(x='D$LAB_TSC', y='D$LAB_HDL')

  # Example2: generate a grid density object for each study separately
  ds.densityGrid(x='D$LAB_TSC', y='D$LAB_HDL', type="split")

  # Example3: generate a grid density object where the number of intervals is set to 15, for
              each study separately
  ds.densityGrid(x='D$LAB_TSC', y='D$LAB_HDL', type="split", numints=15)

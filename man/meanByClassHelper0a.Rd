\title{Computes the mean values of a numeric vector across a factor vector}
\usage{
meanByClassHelper0a(a, b, type, datasources)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{a character, the name of a numeric vector.}

\item{b}{a character, the name of a factor vector.}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. If \code{type} is set to
'combine', a pooled table of results is generated. If \code{type} is set to 'split', a table of results
is genrated for each study.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers; these objects hold
also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
a table or a list of tables that hold the length of the numeric variable and its mean
and standard deviation in each subgroup (subset).
}
\description{
This is an internal function.
}
\details{


This function is called by the function 'ds.meanByClass' to produce the final tables
if the user specifies two loose vectors.

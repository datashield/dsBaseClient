\title{Turns a vector into character type vector}
\usage{
ds.asCharacter(x = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of the input vector.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new vector.If this argument is set to NULL, the name of the new 
variable is the name of the input variable with the suffixe '_char'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.
By default an internal function looks for 'opal' objects in the environment and sets this parameter.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned to the client, the new object is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{as.character}.
}
\details{
See details of the R function 'as.character'.
}
\examples{
{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)
  library(opal)

  # login and assign specific variable(s) 
  # (by default the assigned dataset is a dataframe named 'D')
  myvar <- list("GENDER")
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # turn the factor variable 'GENDER' into a character vector
  ds.asCharacter(x='D$GENDER', newobj="gender_char")

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

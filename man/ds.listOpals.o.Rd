\title{ds.listOpals list all Opal objects in the analytic environment}
\usage{
ds.listOpals.o()
}
\value{
Lists all of the sets of Opals currently found in the analytic environment and advises
the user how best to respond depending whether there are zero, one or multiple Opals detected.
}
\description{
ds.listOpals calls the internal DataSHIELD function getOpals() which identifies
all Opal objects in the analytic environment.
}
\details{
ds.listOpals calls the internal DataSHIELD function getOpals() which identifies
all Opal objects in the analytic environment. If there are no Opal servers in the analytic
environment ds.listOpalsIreminds the user that they have to login to a valid set of Opal
login objects, if they wish to use DataSHIELD. If there is only one set of Opals, ds.listOpals
copies that one set and names the copy 'default.opals'. This default set will then be used by
default by all subsequent calls to client-side functions. If there is more than one set of Opals
in the analytic environment, ds.listOpals tells the user that they can either explicitly specify the
Opals to be used by each client-side function by providing an explicit "datasources=" argument
for each call, or can alternatively use the ds.setDefaultOpals function to specify a default
set of Opals to be used by all client-side calls unless over-ruled by the 'datasources=' argument.

\alias{ds.unList}
\title{Flattens Server-Side Lists}
\usage{
ds.unList(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name}{a character string specifying the name of the input object to be unlisted.}

\item{newobj}{a character string that provides the name for the output variable 
that is stored on the data servers. Default \code{unlist.newobj}.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} 
objects obtained after login. If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.unList} returns to the server-side the unlist object. 
Also, two validity messages are returned to the client-side 
indicating whether the new object has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form.
}
\description{
Coerces an object of list class back to the class it was when
it was coerced into a list.
}
\details{
This function is similar to the native R function \code{unlist}.

When an object is coerced to a list, depending
on the class of the original object some information may be lost. Thus,
for example, when a data frame is coerced to list the information that
underpins the structure of the data frame is lost and when it is
subject to the function \code{ds.unList} it is returned to a simpler
class than data frame e.g. numeric (basically a numeric vector
containing all of the original data in all variables in the data frame
but with no structure). If you wish to reconstruct the original
data frame you, therefore, need to specify this structure again e.g.
the column names, etc. 

Server function called: \code{unListDS}

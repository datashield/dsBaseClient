\usage{
ds.matrixDet.report(M1 = NULL, logarithm = FALSE, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix for which
determinant to be calculated}

\item{logarithm}{logical. Default is FALSE, which returns the
determinant itself, TRUE returns the logarithm of the modulus of the determinant.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
the matrix determinant for A to the clientside. Calculated separately
for each study. The determinant is reported as a two component list. Element 1
is $modulus and element 2 is $sign. If logarithm=FALSE: $modulus reports the
absolute value of the determinant and is therefore always positive. $sign
indicates whether the determinant is positive ($sign=1) or negative ($sign=-1).
$modulus has an attribute [attr(,"logarithm")] which is FALSE if the argument
<logarithm> was FALSE - this enables you to look at results post-hoc to determine
whether the logarithm argument was TRUE or FALSE. If you wish to generate the
actual determinant if logarithm=FALSE it is easiest to calculate $modulus*$sign.
If logarithm=TRUE: $modulus reports the log (to base e) of the absolute value
of the determinant. $sign again reports whether the determinant is positive
($sign=1) or negative ($sign=-1). The attribute of $modulus [attr(,"logarithm")]
is now TRUE. If you wish to generate the actual determinant when logarithm=TRUE
you calculate exp($modulus)*$sign. If the function fails in any study for
a reason which is identified, an explanatory error message is returned
instead of the object containing the calculated matrix determinant

\description{
Calculates the determinant of a square matrix A and returns
the result to the clientside
}
\details{
Calculates the determinant of a square matrix (for additional
information see help for {determinant} function in native R). This operation is only
possible if the number of columns and rows of A are the same.

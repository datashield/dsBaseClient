\title{Checks if the elements in the glm model have the right characteristics}
\usage{
glmChecks(formula, data, offset, weights, datasources)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a character, a regression formula given as a string character}

\item{data}{a character, the name of an optional data frame containing the variables in 
in the \code{formula}.}

\item{offset}{null or a numreric vector that can be used to specify an a priori known component to be 
included in the linear predictor during fitting.}

\item{weights}{a character, the name of an optional vector of 'prior weights' to be used in the fitting 
process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
an integer 0 if check was passed and 1 if failed
}
\description{
This is an internal function required by the client function \code{ds.glm} 
to verify all the variables and ensure the process does not halt inadvertanly.
}
\details{
the variables are checked to ensure they are defined, not empty (i.e. are not missing 
at complete) and evantually (if 'offset' or 'weights') are of 'numeric' with non negative value 
(if 'weights').

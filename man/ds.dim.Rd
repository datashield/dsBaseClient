\title{Retrieves the dimension of an object}
\usage{
ds.dim(x = NULL, type = "both", checks = FALSE, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of R table object, for example a matrix, array or data frame}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. 
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', 'combined', 'combines' or 'c', the global dimension is returned. 
If \code{type} is set to 'split', 'splits' or 's', the dimension is returned separately for each study.
If \code{type} is set to 'both' or 'b', both sets of outputs are produced.}

\item{checks}{a Boolean indicator of whether to undertake optional checks of model
components. Defaults to checks=FALSE to save time. It is suggested that checks
should only be undertaken once the function call has failed.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
The function retrieves the dimension of the object in the form of a vector where the first
element indicates the number of rows and the second element indicates the number of columns.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{dim}
}
\details{
The function returns the dimension of the input object (e.g. array, matrix or data frame)
from each single study and the pooled dimension of the object by summing up the individual 
dimensions returned from each study.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign all the stored variables.
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata, assign=TRUE)

  # Example 1: Get the dimension of the assigned datasets in each study
  ds.dim(x='D', type='split')

  # Example 2: Get the pooled dimension of the assigned datasets
  ds.dim(x='D', type='combine')

  # Example 3: Get the dimension of the datasets in each single study
  # and the pooled dimension - default
  ds.dim(x='D', type='both') 

  # Example 4: Input has to be either matrix, data frame or an array
  # In the below example, the input is a vector so it will not work.
  ds.dim(x='D$LAB_TSC')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

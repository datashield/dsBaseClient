\title{Generates valid subset(s) of a data frame or a factor}
\usage{
ds.subsetByClass(x = NULL, subsets = "subClasses", variables = NULL,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of the dataframe or the vector to generate subsets from.}

\item{subsets}{the name of the output object, a list that holds the subset objects. If set to NULL
the default name of this list is 'subClasses'.}

\item{variables}{a vector of string characters, the name(s) of the variables to subset by.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
a no data are return to the user but messages are printed out.
}
\description{
The function takes a categorical variable or a data frame as input and generates
subset(s)  variables or data frames for each category.
}
\details{


If the input data object is a data frame it is possible to specify  the variables
to subset on. If a subset is not 'valid' all its the values are reported as missing (i.e. NA),
the name of the subsets is labelled with the suffix '_INVALID'. Subsets are considered invalid if
the number of observations it holds are between 1 and the threshold allowed by the data owner. if
a subset is empty (i.e. no entries) the name of the subset is labelled with the suffix '_EMPTY'.

\examples{
{

  # load the login data
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign some variables to R
  myvar <- list('DIS_DIAB','PM_BMI_CONTINUOUS','LAB_HDL', 'GENDER')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # Example 1: generate all possible subsets from the table assigned above (one subset table for each class in each factor)
  ds.subsetByClass(x='D', subsets='subclasses')
  # display the names of the subset tables that were generated in each study
  ds.names('subclasses')

  # Example 2: subset the table initially assigned by the variable 'GENDER'
  ds.subsetByClass(x='D', subsets='subtables', variables='GENDER')
  # display the names of the subset tables that were generated in each study
  ds.names('subtables')

  # Example 3: generate a new variable 'gender' and split it into two vectors: males and females
  ds.assign(toAssign='D$GENDER', newobj='gender')
  ds.subsetByClass(x='gender', subsets='subvectors')
  # display the names of the subset vectors that were generated in each study
  ds.names('subvectors')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

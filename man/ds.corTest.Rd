\title{Tests for correlation between paired samples in the server-side}
\usage{
ds.corTest(
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  method = "pearson",
  exact = NULL,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  type = "split",
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character string providing the name of a numerical vector.}

\item{y}{a character string providing the name of a numerical vector.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be
used for the test. One of "pearson", "kendall", or "spearman", can be abbreviated. 
Default is set to "pearson".}

\item{exact}{a logical indicating whether an exact p-value should be computed. Used for
Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho. See ‘Details’ of R stats function \code{cor.test} for
the meaning of NULL (the default).}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval. Currently
only used for the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient if there are at least
4 complete pairs of observations. Default is set to 0.95.}

\item{type}{a character string that represents the type of analysis to carry out. 
This must be set to \code{'split'} or \code{'combine'}. Default is set to \code{'split'}. If 
\code{type} is set to "combine" then an approximated pooled correlation is estimated based on 
Fisher's z transformation.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link[DSI]{DSConnection-class}} 
objects obtained after login. If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link[DSI]{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.corTest} returns to the client-side the results of the correlation test.
}
\description{
This is similar to the R stats function \code{cor.test}.
}
\details{
Runs a two-sided correlation test between paired samples, using one of
Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient, Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho.
Server function called: \code{corTestDS}

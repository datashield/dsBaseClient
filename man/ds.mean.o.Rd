\title{Computes the statistical mean of a given vector}
\usage{
ds.mean.o(x = NULL, type = "split", checks = FALSE,
  save.mean.Nvalid = FALSE, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, typically the name of a numerical vector}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. 
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', 'combined', 'combines' or 'c', a global mean is calculated 
if \code{type} is set to 'split', 'splits' or 's', the mean is calculated separately for each study.
if \code{type} is set to 'both' or 'b', both sets of outputs are produced}

\item{checks}{a Boolean indicator of whether to undertake optional checks of model
components. Defaults to checks=FALSE to save time. It is suggested that checks
should only be undertaken once the function call has failed}

\item{save.mean.Nvalid}{a Boolean indicator of whether the user wishes to save the
generated values of the mean and of the number of valid (non-missing) observations into
the R environments at each of the data servers. Will save study-specific means and Nvalids
as well as the global equivalents across all studies combined. Once the estimated means and Nvalids
are written into the server-side R environments, they can be used directly to centralize 
the variable of interest around its global mean or its study-specific means. Finally,
the isDefined internal function checks whether the key variables have been created.}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use, if it is not specified
the default set of opals will be used. The default opals are always called default.opals.
This parameter is set without inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals
If you wish to specify the second opal server in a set of three, the parameter is specified:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[2]. If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[2,3]}
}
\value{
a list including: Mean.by.Study = estimated mean in each study separately (if type = split or both), with Nmissing
(number of missing observations), Nvalid (number of valid observations), Ntotal (sum of missing and valid observations)
also reported separately for each study; Global.Mean = Mean, Nmissing, Nvalid, Ntotal across all studies combined
(if type = combine or both); Nstudies = number of studies being analysed; ValidityMessage indicates whether 
a full analysis was possible or whether one or more studies had fewer valid observations than the nfilter
threshold for the minimum cell size in a contingency table. If save.mean.Nvalid=TRUE, ds.mean.o writes
the objects "Nvalid.all.studies", "Nvalid.study.specific", "mean.all.studies", and "mean.study.specific"
to the serverside on each server
}
\description{
This function is similar to the R function \code{mean}.
}
\details{
It is a wrapper for the server side function.

#  # Example 1: compute the pooled statistical mean of the variable 'LAB_TSC' - default behaviour
#  ds.mean(x='D$LAB_TSC')
#
#  # Example 2: compute the statistical mean of each study separately
#  ds.mean(x='D$LAB_TSC', type='split')

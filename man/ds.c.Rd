\title{Combines values into a vector or list}
\usage{
ds.c(x = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, a vector that holds the names of the objects to combine.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the output object. If this argument is set to NULL,
the name of the new object is 'newObject'.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned to the client, the new object is stored on the server side.
}
\description{
Concatenates object into one object.
}
\details{


To avoid combining the character names and not the vectors
on the client side, the names are coerce into a list and the server side
function loops through that list to concatenate the list's elements into a vector.
}
\examples{
{

  # load the file that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign specific variable(s)
  # (by default the assigned dataset is a dataframe named 'D')
  myvar <- c('LAB_TSC', 'LAB_HDL')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # Get the variables 'LAB_TSC' by 'LAB_HDL' from the dataframe 'D' and combine them
  myvect <- c('D$LAB_TSC', 'D$LAB_HDL')
  ds.assign(toAssign='D$LAB_TSC', newobj='labtsc')
  ds.assign(toAssign='D$LAB_HDL', newobj='labhdl')
  myvect <- c('labtsc', 'labhdl')
  ds.c(x=myvect)

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

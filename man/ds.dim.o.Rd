\alias{ds.dim.o}
\title{Retrieves the dimension of an object}
\usage{
ds.dim.o(x = NULL, type = "both", checks = FALSE,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of R table object, for example a matrix, array or data frame}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. 
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', 'combined', 'combines' or 'c', the global dimension is returned 
if \code{type} is set to 'split', 'splits' or 's', the dimension is returned separately for each study.
if \code{type} is set to 'both' or 'b', both sets of outputs are produced}

\item{checks}{a Boolean indicator of whether to undertake optional checks of model
components. Defaults to checks=FALSE to save time. It is suggested that checks
should only be undertaken once the function call has failed}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
for an array, \code{NULL} or a vector of mode \code{integer}
}
\description{
this function is similar to R function \code{dim}
}
\details{
the function returns the unpooled or pooled dimension of the object by summing
up the individual dimensions returned from each study or the dimension of the object in each 
study. Unlike the other DataSHIELD function the default behaviour is to output the dimension 
of each study separately.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign all the stored variables.
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE)

  # Example 1: Get the dimension of the assigned datasets in each study
  ds.dim(x='D', type='combine')

  # Example 2: Get the pooled dimension of the assigned datasets
  ds.dim(x='D', type='combine')

  # Example 3: Get the dimension og the datasets in each single study
  # and the pooled dimension  - default
  ds.dim(x='D') 

  # Example 4: Input has to be either matrix, data frame or an array
  # In the below example, the inpout is a vector so it will not work.
  ds.dim(x='D$LAB_TSC')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

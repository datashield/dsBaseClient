\title{Gets the subset tables out of the list (i.e. unlist)}
\usage{
meanByClassHelper4(dtsource, alist, initialtable, variable = NA,
  categories = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtsource}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}

\item{alist}{the name of the list that holds the final subset tables}

\item{initialtable}{a character the name of the table that the subset were generated from}

\item{variable}{a character, the variable to subset on}

\item{categories}{a character vector, the classes in the variables to subset on}
}
\value{
the 'loose' subset tables are stored on the server side
}
\description{
This is an internal function.
}
\details{


This function is called by the function 'ds.meanByClass' to obtain 'loose'
subset tables because the 'subsetByClass' function does not handle a table within a list.

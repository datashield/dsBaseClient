\title{Checks if an object is valid}
\usage{
ds.isValid(x = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of a vector, dataframe or matrix.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.
By default an internal function looks for 'opal' objects in the environment and sets this parameter.}
}
\value{
a boolean, TRUE if input object is valid and FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
Checks if a vector or table structure has a number of observations equal to or greater
than the threshold set by DataSHIELD.
}
\details{
In DataSHIELD, analyses are possible only on valid objects to ensure the ouput is not disclosive.
This function checks if an input object is valid. A vector is valid if the 
number of observations are equal to or greater than a set threshold. A factor vector is valid if all
its levels (categories) have a count equal or greater than the set threshold. A dataframe or a matrix 
is valid if the number of rows is equal or greater than the set threshold.

\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign specific variable(s)
  myvar <- list("LAB_TSC", "GENDER")
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # Example 1: Check if the dataframe assigned above is valid
  ds.isValid(x='D')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

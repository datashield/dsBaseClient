\title{ds.var.o calling aggregate function varDS.o}
\usage{
ds.var.o(x = NULL, type = "split", checks = FALSE,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of a numerical vector.}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out. 
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', 'combined', 'combines' or 'c', a global variance is calculated 
if \code{type} is set to 'split', 'splits' or 's', the variance is calculated separately for each study.
if \code{type} is set to 'both' or 'b', both sets of outputs are produced}

\item{checks}{a Boolean indicator of whether to undertake optional checks of model
components. Defaults to checks=FALSE to save time. It is suggested that checks
should only be undertaken once the function call has failed}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
a list including: Variance.by.Study = estimated variance in each study separately (if type = split or both), with Nmissing
(number of missing observations), Nvalid (number of valid observations), Ntotal (sum of missing and valid observations)
also reported separately for each study; Global.Variance = Variance, Nmissing, Nvalid, Ntotal across all studies combined
(if type = combine or both); Nstudies = number of studies being analysed; ValidityMessage indicates whether 
a full analysis was possible or whether one or more studies had fewer valid observations than the nfilter
threshold for the minimum cell size in a contingency table.
}
\description{
Computes the variance of a given vector
This function is similar to the R function \code{var}.
}
\details{
It is a wrapper for the server side function. 
The server side function returns a list with the sum of the input variable, the sum of squares
of the input variable, the number of missing values, the number of valid values, the number of
total lenght of the variable, and a study message indicating whether the number of valid is less
than the disclosure threshold. The variance is calculated at the client side by the formula 
$\deqn{var(X)}{\frac{\sum{x_i^2}}{N-1}-\frac{(\sum{x_i})^2}{N(N-1)}}$
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load that contains the login details
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign specific variable(s)
  myvar <- list('LAB_TSC')
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # Example 1: compute the pooled variance of the variable 'LAB_TSC' - default behaviour
  ds.var(x='D$LAB_TSC')

  # Example 2: compute the variance of each study separately
  ds.var(x='D$LAB_TSC', type='split')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

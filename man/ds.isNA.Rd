\title{Checks if a vector is empty}
\usage{
ds.isNA(x = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of the vector to check.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.
By default an internal function looks for 'opal' objects in the environment and sets this parameter.}
}
\value{
a boolean 'TRUE' if the vector is empty (all values are 'NA') and 'FALSE'  otherwise.
}
\description{
this function is similar to R function \code{is.na} but instead of a vector 
of booleans it returns just one boolean to tell if all the elements are missing values.
}
\details{
In certain analyses such as GLM none of the variable should be missing at complete
(i.e. missing value for each observation). Since in DataSHIELD it is not possible to see the data
it is important to know whether or not a vector is empty to proceed accordingly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

  # load the login data
  data(logindata)

  # login and assign specific variable(s)
  myvar <- list("LAB_HDL")
  opals <- datashield.login(logins=logindata,assign=TRUE,variables=myvar)

  # check if all the observation of the variable 'LAB_HDL' are missing (NA)
  ds.isNA(x='D$LAB_HDL')

  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
  datashield.logout(opals)

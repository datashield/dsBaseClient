\title{Calculates matrix diagonals in the server-side}
\usage{
ds.matrixDiag(
  x1 = NULL,
  aim = NULL,
  nrows.scalar = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{a character string specifying
the name of a server-side scalar or vector. Also, a numeric value or vector
specified from the client-side can be specified. This argument depends 
on the value specified in \code{aim}.
For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{aim}{a character string specifying the behaviour of the function.
This can be set as: 
\code{"serverside.vector.2.matrix"}, \code{"serverside.scalar.2.matrix"},
\code{"serverside.matrix.2.vector"}, \code{"clientside.vector.2.matrix"}
or \code{"clientside.scalar.2.matrix"}.
For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{nrows.scalar}{an integer specifying the dimensions of the matrix 
note that the matrix is square (same number of rows and columns).  
If this argument is not specified the matrix dimensions are 
defined by the length of the vector. 
For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{newobj}{a character string that provides the name for the output 
variable that is stored on the data servers. Default \code{matrixdiag.newobj}.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link[DSI]{DSConnection-class}} 
objects obtained after login. If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link[DSI]{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
\code{ds.matrixDiag} returns to the server-side the square matrix diagonal. 
Also, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether the new object has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form.
}
\description{
Extracts the diagonal vector from a square matrix  or
creates a diagonal matrix  based on a vector or a scalar value 
on the server-side.
}
\details{
The function behaviour is different depending on the 
value specified in the \code{aim} argument:\cr
(1) \code{If aim = "serverside.vector.2.matrix"}
the function takes a server-side vector and writes out a square matrix with
the vector as its diagonal and all off-diagonal \code{values = 0}. The dimensions
of the output matrix are determined by the length of the vector.
If the vector length is \code{k}, the output matrix has \code{k} rows and \code{k} columns.\cr
(2) If \code{aim = "serverside.scalar.2.matrix"}
the function takes a server-side scalar and writes out a square matrix with all
diagonal values equal to the value of the scalar
and all off-diagonal \code{values = 0}. The dimensions of the square
matrix are determined by the value of the \code{nrows.scalar} argument.\cr
(3) If \code{aim = "serverside.matrix.2.vector"}
the function takes a square server-side matrix and extracts
its diagonal values as a vector which is written to the server-side.\cr
(4) If \code{aim = "clientside.vector.2.matrix"}
the function takes a vector specified on the client-side
and writes out a square matrix to the server-side with
the vector as its diagonal and all off-diagonal \code{values = 0}. The dimensions
of the output matrix are determined by the length of the vector.\cr
(5) If \code{aim = "clientside.scalar.2.matrix"}
the function takes a scalar specified on the client-side
and writes out a square matrix with all diagonal values equal
to the value of the scalar. The dimensions of the square
matrix are determined by the value of the \code{nrows.scalar} argument.

If \code{x1} is a vector and the \code{nrows.scalar} 
is set as \code{k}, the vector will be used
repeatedly to fill up the diagonal. For example, the vector is of length
7 and \code{nrows.scalar = 18}, a square diagonal matrix with
18 rows and 18 columns will be created.

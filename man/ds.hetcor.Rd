\usage{
ds.hetcor(
  data = NULL,
  ML = TRUE,
  std.err = TRUE,
  bins = 4,
  pd = TRUE,
  use = "complete.obs",
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the name of a data frame consisting of factors, ordered factors, logical variables,
character variables, and/or numeric variables, or the first of several variables.}

\item{ML}{if TRUE, compute maximum-likelihood estimates; if FALSE (default), compute quick
two-step estimates.}

\item{std.err}{if TRUE (default), compute standard errors.}

\item{bins}{number of bins to use for continuous variables in testing bivariate normality;
the default is 4.}

\item{pd}{if TRUE (default) and if the correlation matrix is not positive-definite, an attempt
will be made to adjust it to a positive-definite matrix, using the nearPD function in the Matrix
package. Note that default arguments to nearPD are used (except corr=TRUE); for more control call
nearPD directly.}

\item{use}{if "complete.obs", remove observations with any missing data; if "pairwise.complete.obs",
compute each correlation using all observations with valid data for that pair of variables.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. 
If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified the default set of connections will be
used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "hetcor" from each study, with the following components: the
correlation matrix; the type of each correlation: "Pearson", "Polychoric", or "Polyserial"; the
standard errors of the correlations, if requested; the number (or numbers) of observations on which
the correlations are based; p-values for tests of bivariate normality for each pair of variables; 
the method by which any missing data were handled: "complete.obs" or "pairwise.complete.obs"; TRUE 
for ML estimates, FALSE for two-step estimates.
}
\description{
This function is based on the hetcor function from the R package \code{polycor}.
}
\details{
Computes a heterogenous correlation matrix, consisting of Pearson product-moment
correlations between numeric variables, polyserial correlations between numeric and ordinal
variables, and polychoric correlations between ordinal variables.

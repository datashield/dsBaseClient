\usage{
ds.histogram.o(x = NULL, type = "split", num.breaks = 10,
  method = "smallCellsRule", k = 3, noise = 0.25,
  vertical.axis = "Frequency", datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a charcater, the name of the vector of values for which the histogram is desired.}

\item{type}{a character which represent the type of graph to display. If \code{type} is set to
'combine', a histogram that merges the single plot is displayed. Each histogram is plotted
separately if \code{type} is set to 'split'.}

\item{num.breaks}{a numeric specifying the number of breaks of the histogram. The default value
is set to 10.}

\item{method}{a character which defines which histogram will be created. If \code{method}
is set to 'smallCellsRule' (default option), the histogram of the actual variable is
created but bins with low counts are removed. If \code{method} is set to 'deterministic'
the histogram of the scaled centroids of each k nearest neighbours of the original variable
where the value of \code{k} is set by the user. If the \code{method} is set
to 'probabilistic', then the histogram shows the original distribution disturbed by the addition
of random stochastic noise. The added noise follows a normal distribution with zero mean and
variance equal to a percentage of the initial variance of the input variable. This percentage is
specified by the user in the argument \code{noise}.}

\item{k}{the number of the nearest neghbours for which their centroid is calculated.
The user can choose any value for k equal to or greater than the pre-specified threshold
used as a disclosure control for this method and lower than the number of observations
minus the value of this threshold. By default the value of k is set to be equal to 3
(we suggest k to be equal to, or bigger than, 3). Note that the function fails if the user
uses the default value but the study has set a bigger threshold. The value of k is used only
if the argument \code{method} is set to 'deterministic'. Any value of k is ignored if the
argument \code{method} is set to 'probabilistic' or 'smallCellsRule'.}

\item{noise}{the percentage of the initial variance that is used as the variance of the embedded
noise if the argument \code{method} is set to 'probabilistic'. Any value of noise is ignored if
the argument \code{method} is set to 'deterministic' or 'smallCellsRule'. The user can choose
any value for noise equal to or greater than the pre-specified threshold 'nfilter.noise'.
By default the value of noise is set to be equal to 0.25.}

\item{vertical.axis, }{a character which defines what is shown in the vertical axis of the
plot. If \code{vertical.axis} is set to 'Frequency' then the histogram of the frequencies
is returned. If \code{vertical.axis} is set to 'Density' then the histogram of the densities
is returned.}

\item{datasources}{a list of opal object(s) obtained after login in to opal servers;
these objects hold also the data assign to R, as \code{dataframe}, from opal datasources.}
}
\value{
one or more histogram objects and plots depending on the argument \code{type}
}
\description{
This function plots a non-disclosive histogram
}
\details{
It calls a datashield server side function that produces the
histogram objects to plot. Two options are possible as identified by the argument
\code{method}. The first option creates a histogram that excludes bins with
counts smaller than the allowed threshold. The second option creates a histogram
of the centroids of each k nearest neighbours. The function allows for the user to plot
disctinct histograms (one for each study) or a combine histogram that merges
the single plots.

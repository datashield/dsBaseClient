}
\value{
Many of the elements of the output list returned by \code{ds.glmerSLMA} are 
equivalent to those returned by the \code{glmer()} function in native R. However,
potentially disclosive elements
such as individual-level residuals and linear predictor values are blocked. 
In this case, only non-disclosive elements are returned from each study separately.

The list of elements returned by \code{ds.glmerSLMA} is mentioned below:

\code{coefficients}: a matrix with 5 columns:
   \describe{
   \item{First}{: the names of all of the regression parameters (coefficients) in the model} 
   \item{second}{: the estimated values} 
   \item{third}{: corresponding standard errors of the estimated values} 
   \item{fourth}{: the ratio of estimate/standard error} 
   \item{fifth}{: the p-value treating that as a standardised normal deviate} 
}

\code{CorrMatrix}: the correlation matrix of parameter estimates.

\code{VarCovMatrix}: the variance-covariance matrix of parameter estimates.

\code{weights}: the vector (if any) holding regression weights.

\code{offset}: the vector (if any) holding an offset.

\code{cov.scaled}: equivalent to \code{VarCovMatrix}.

\code{Nmissing}: the number of missing observations in the given study.

\code{Nvalid}: the number of valid (non-missing) observations in the given study.

\code{Ntotal}: the total number of observations 
                       in the given study (\code{Nvalid} + \code{Nmissing}).

\code{data}: equivalent to input parameter \code{dataName} (above).

\code{call}: summary of key elements of the call to fit the model.

Once the study-specific output has been returned, the function returns the
number of elements relating to the pooling of estimates across studies via
study-level meta-analysis. These are as follows:

\code{input.beta.matrix.for.SLMA}: a matrix containing the vector of coefficient
estimates from each study.

\code{input.se.matrix.for.SLMA}: a matrix containing the vector of standard error
estimates for coefficients from each study.

\code{SLMA.pooled.estimates}: a matrix containing pooled estimates for each
regression coefficient across all studies with pooling under SLMA via
random-effects meta-analysis under maximum likelihood (ML), restricted maximum
likelihood (REML) or via fixed-effects meta-analysis (FE).

\code{convergence.error.message}: reports for each study whether the model converged.
If it did not some information about the reason for this is reported.

\description{
\code{ds.glmerSLMA} fits a Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Model
(GLME) on data from one or multiple sources with pooling via SLMA (study-level meta-analysis).
}
\details{
\code{ds.glmerSLMA} fits a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLME) 
- e.g. a logistic or Poisson regression model including both fixed and random effects -
 on data from single or multiple sources. 
 
 This function is similar to \code{glmer} function from \code{lme4} package in native R.
 
 When there are multiple data sources, the GLME is fitted to convergence 
 in each data source independently. The estimates and standard errors returned
 to the client-side which enable cross-study pooling  using Study-Level Meta-Analysis (SLMA).
 The SLMA used by default \code{metafor} package  
 but as the SLMA occurs on the client-side (a standard R environment), the user can choose 
 any approach to meta-analysis. Additional information about fitting GLMEs 
 using \code{glmer} function can be obtained using R help for \code{glmer} and the \code{lme4} package. 
 
In \code{formula} most shortcut notation allowed by \code{glmer()} function is
also allowed by \code{ds.glmerSLMA}. 
Many GLMEs can be fitted very simply using a formula like:
\deqn{y~a+b+(1|c)} 
which simply means fit an GLME  with \code{y} as the outcome variable (e.g. 
a binary case-control using a logistic regression model or a count or a survival
time using a Poisson regression model), \code{a} and \code{b}
as fixed effects, and \code{c} as a random effect or grouping factor. 

It is also possible to fit models with random slopes by specifying a model such as 
\deqn{y~a+b+(1+b|c)} 
where the effect of \code{b} can vary randomly between groups defined by \code{c}.
Implicit nesting can be specified with formulas such as: \eqn{y~a+b+(1|c/d)}
or \eqn{y~a+b+(1|c)+(1|c:d)}. 


The \code{dataName} argument avoids you having to specify the name of the
data frame in front of each covariate in the formula. 
For example, if the data frame is called \code{DataFrame} you avoid having to write: 
\eqn{DataFrame\$y ~ DataFrame\$a + DataFrame\$b + (1 | DataFrame\$c)}.

The \code{checks} argument verifies that the variables in the model are all defined (exist) 
on the server-site at every study
and that they have the correct characteristics required to fit the model. 
It is suggested to make \code{checks} argument TRUE if an unexplained
problem in the model fit is encountered because the running process takes several minutes.


In the \code{family} argument can be specified two types of models to fit:
 \describe{
   \item{\code{"binomial"}}{: logistic regression models}
   \item{\code{"poisson"}}{: poisson regression models}
}

Note if you are fitting a gaussian model (a standard linear mixed
model) you should use \code{ds.lmerSLMA} and not \code{ds.glmerSLMA}. 
For more information you can see R help for \code{lmer} and \code{glmer}. 

In \code{control_type} at present only one such parameter can be modified,
namely the tolerance of the convergence criterion to the gradient of the log-likelihood 
at the maximum likelihood achieved. We have enabled this because our practical experience
suggests that in situations where the model looks to have converged with sensible parameter
values but formal convergence is not being declared if we allow the model to be more
tolerant to a non-zero gradient the same parameter values are obtained but formal
convergence is declared. The default value for the \code{check.conv.grad} is \code{0.001} (note that
the default value of this argument in \code{ds.lmerSLMA} is  \code{0.002}). 

In \code{control_value} at present (see \code{control_type})
the only parameter this can be is the convergence tolerance \code{check.conv.grad}. In
general, models will be identified as having converged more readily if the value set
for \code{check.conv.grad} is increased from its default value (\code{0.001}).  Please note
that the risk of doing this is that the model is also more likely to be declared
as having converged at a local maximum that is not the global maximum likelihood.
This will not generally be a problem if the likelihood surface is well behaved but if
you have a problem with convergence you might usefully compare all the parameter
estimates and standard errors obtained using the default tolerance (\code{0.001}) even though
that has not formally converged with those obtained after convergence using the higher
tolerance.

\title{ds.setDefaultOpals creates a default set of Opal objects called 'default.opals'}
\usage{
ds.setDefaultOpals.o(opal.name)
}
\value{
Copies a specified set of Opals (on the client-side server)
and calls the copy 'default.opals'
}
\description{
creates a default set of Opal objects called 'default.opals
}
\details{
By default if there is only one set of opals that is available for
analysis, all DataSHIELD client-side functions will
use that full set of Opals unless the 'datasources=' argument has been set and specifies that
a particular subset of those Opals should be used instead. The correct identification of the full
single set of opals is based on the findLoginObjects() function which is an internal DataSHIELD
function that is run at the start of nearly every client side function.
To illustrate, if the single set of Opals is called 'study.opals' and consists of
six opals numbered study.opals[1] to study.opals[6] then all client-side functions will
use data from all six of these 'study.opals' unless, say, datasources=study.opals[c(2,5)] is
declared and only data from the second and fifth studies will then be used.
On the other hand, if there is more than one set of Opals in the analytic environment client-side functions will
be unable to determine which set to use. The function findLoginObjects() has therefore been
written so that if one of the Opal sets is called 'default.opals' then that set -
i.e. 'default.opals' - will be selected by default by all DataSHIELD client-side functions. If there is more
than one set of Opals in the analytic environment and NONE of
these is called 'default.opals', the function ds.setDefaultOpals() therefore copies
one set of opals and to name that copy 'default.opals'. This set will then be selected
by default by all client-side functions, unless it is deleted and an alternative set of
opals is copied and named 'default.opals'. Regardless how many sets of opals exist and
regardless whether any of them may be called 'default.opals', the 'datasources=' argument
overrides the defaults and allows the user to base his/her  analysis on any set of opals
and any subset of those opals. An earlier version of
'findLoginObjects()' asked the user to specify which Opal to choose
if no default could be identified, but that did not work in all versions of R
and so has been removed.

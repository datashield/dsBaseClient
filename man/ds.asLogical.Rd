\title{ds.asLogical calling assign function asLogicalDS}
\usage{
ds.asLogical(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name}{the name of the input object to be coerced to class
logical. Must be specified in inverted commas.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new output variable. If this argument is set
to NULL, the name of the new variable is defaulted to 'aslogical.newobj'}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or by default <x.name>.logic
if the <newobj> argument is NULL) which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study there may
be a studysideMessage that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message}
function. If you type ds.message(<newobj>) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(<newobj>)
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

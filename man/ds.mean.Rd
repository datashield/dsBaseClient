\title{Computes the statistical mean of a given vector}
\usage{
ds.mean(
  x = NULL,
  type = "split",
  checks = FALSE,
  save.mean.Nvalid = FALSE,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, typically the name of a numerical vector}

\item{type}{a character which represents the type of analysis to carry out.
If \code{type} is set to 'combine', 'combined', 'combines' or 'c', a global mean is calculated
if \code{type} is set to 'split', 'splits' or 's', the mean is calculated separately for each study.
if \code{type} is set to 'both' or 'b', both sets of outputs are produced}

\item{checks}{a Boolean indicator of whether to undertake optional checks of model
components. Defaults to checks=FALSE to save time. It is suggested that checks
should only be undertaken once the function call has failed}

\item{save.mean.Nvalid}{a Boolean indicator of whether the user wishes to save the
generated values of the mean and of the number of valid (non-missing) observations into
the R environments at each of the data servers. Will save study-specific means and Nvalids
as well as the global equivalents across all studies combined. Once the estimated means and Nvalids
are written into the server-side R environments, they can be used directly to centralize
the variable of interest around its global mean or its study-specific means. Finally,
the isDefined internal function checks whether the key variables have been created.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}
}
\value{
a list including: Mean.by.Study = estimated mean in each study separately (if type = split or both), with Nmissing
(number of missing observations), Nvalid (number of valid observations), Ntotal (sum of missing and valid observations)
also reported separately for each study; Global.Mean = Mean, Nmissing, Nvalid, Ntotal across all studies combined
(if type = combine or both); Nstudies = number of studies being analysed; ValidityMessage indicates whether
a full analysis was possible or whether one or more studies had fewer valid observations than the nfilter
threshold for the minimum cell size in a contingency table. If save.mean.Nvalid=TRUE, ds.mean writes
the objects "Nvalid.all.studies", "Nvalid.study.specific", "mean.all.studies", and "mean.study.specific"
to the serverside on each server
}
\description{
This function is similar to the R function \code{mean}.
}
\details{
It is a wrapper for the server side function.

#  # load that contains the login details

#  # login and assign specific variable(s)
#  myvar <- list('LAB_TSC')

#
#  # Example 1: compute the pooled statistical mean of the variable 'LAB_TSC' - default behaviour
#  ds.mean(x='D$LAB_TSC')
#
#  # Example 2: compute the statistical mean of each study separately
#  ds.mean(x='D$LAB_TSC', type='split')
#
#  # clear the Datashield R sessions and logout
#  datashield.logout(conns)

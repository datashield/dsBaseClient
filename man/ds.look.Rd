\title{Performs direct call to a server-side aggregate function}
\usage{
ds.look(toAggregate = NULL, checks = FALSE, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{toAggregate}{a character string specifying the function call to be made.
For more information see \strong{Details}.}

\item{checks}{logical. If TRUE the optional checks are undertaken. 
Default FALSE to save time.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link[DSI]{DSConnection-class}} 
objects obtained after login. If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link[DSI]{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
the output from the specified server-side aggregate function to the client-side.
}
\description{
The function \code{ds.look} can be used to make a direct call to a server-side
aggregate function more simply than using the \code{datashield.aggregate} function.
}
\details{
The \code{ds.look} and \code{datashield.aggregate} functions are generally
only recommended for experienced developers. For example, the \code{toAggregate} argument has to
be expressed in the same form that the server-side function would usually expect from its
client-side pair. For example: \code{ds.look("table1DDS(female)")} works. But, if you express
this as \code{ds.look("table1DDS('female')")} it won't work because although when
you call this same function using its client-side function you write \code{ds.table1D('female')}
the inverted commas are stripped off during processing by the client-side function so the
call to the server-side does not contain inverted commas. 

Apart from during development
work (e.g. before a client-side function has been written) it is almost always easier
and less error-prone to call a server-side function using its client-side pair.

The function is a wrapper for the DSI package function \code{datashield.aggregate}.

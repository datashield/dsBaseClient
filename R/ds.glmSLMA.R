#' @title Fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with pooling via Study Level Meta-Analysis (SLMA)
#' @description Fits a generalized linear model (GLM) on data from single or multiple sources
#' with pooled co-analysis across studies being based on SLMA (Study Level Meta Analysis). 
#' @details \code{ds.glmSLMA} specifies the structure of a Generalized Linear Model 
#' to be fitted separately on each study or data source. Calls serverside functions
#' glmSLMADS1 (aggregate),glmSLMADS2 (aggregate) and glmSLMADS.assign (assign). 
#' From a mathematical perspective, the SLMA approach (using \code{ds.glmSLMA})
#' differs fundamentally from the alternative approach using \code{ds.glm}.
#' ds.glm fits the model iteratively across all studies together. At each
#' iteration the model in every data source has precisely the same coefficients
#' so when the model converges one essentially identifies the model that
#' best fits all studies simultaneously. This mathematically equivalent
#' to placing all individual-level data from all sources in
#' one central warehouse and analysing those data as one combined dataset using the
#' conventional \code{glm()} function in native R. In contrast ds.glmSLMA sends
#' a command to every data source to fit the model required but each separate source
#' simply fits that model to completion (ie undertakes all iterations until
#' the model converges) and the estimates (regression coefficients) and their standard
#' errors from each source are sent back to the client and are then pooled using SLMA
#' via any approach the user wishes to implement. The ds.glmSLMA functions includes
#' an argument <combine.with.metafor> which if TRUE (the default) pools the models
#' across studies using the metafor function (from the metafor package) using three
#' optimisation methods: random effects under maximum likelihood (ML); random effects
#' under restricted maximum likelihood (REML); or fixed effects (FE). But once
#' the estimates and standard errors are on the clientside, the user
#' can alternatively choose to use the metafor package in any way he/she wishes,
#' to pool the coefficients across studies or, indeed, to use another
#' meta-analysis package, or their own code.
#' 
#' Although the ds.glm approach might at first sight appear to be preferable
#' under all circumstances, this is not always the case.
#' First, the results from both approaches are generally very
#' similar. Secondly, the SLMA approach can offer key inferential advantages
#' when there is marked heterogeneity between sources that cannot simply be corrected
#' by including fixed-effects in one's ds.glm model that each reflect
#' a study- or centre-specific effect. In particular, such fixed effects cannot
#' be guaranteed to generate formal inferences that
#' are unbiased when there is heterogeneity
#' in the effect that is actually of scientific interest. It might be argued that
#' one should not try to pool the inferences anyway if there is marked heterogeneity,
#' but you can use the joint analysis to formally check for such heterogeneity and then
#' choose to report the pooled result or separate results from each study individually.
#' Crucially, unless the heterogeneity is substantial, pooling can be quite reasonable.
#' Furthermore, if you just fit a ds.glm model without centre-effects you will
#' in effect be pooling across all studies without checking for heterogeneity and
#' if heterogeneity exists and if it is strong you can get theoretically results
#' that are badly confounded by study. Before we introduced ds.glmSLMA we
#' encountered a real world example of a ds.glm (without centre effects)
#' which generated combined inferences over all studies which were more extreme than
#' the results from any of the individual studies: the lower 95% confidence limit
#' of the combined estimate was higher than the upper 95% confidence limits in
#' ALL of the individual studies. This was clearly incorrect and provided a
#' salutary lesson on the potential impact of confounding by study if a ds.glm
#' model does not include appropriate centre-effects. Even if you are going
#' to undertake a ds.glm analysis (which is slightly more powerful when there
#' is no heterogeneity) it may still be useful to also carry out a ds.glmSLMA
#' analysis as this provides a very easy way to examine the extent of heterogeneity.
#'
#' In \code{formula} Most shortcut notation for formulas allowed under R's standard \code{glm()}
#' function is also allowed by \code{ds.glmSLMA}. 
#' 
#' Many glms can be fitted very simply using a formula such as:
#' 
#' \eqn{y~a+b+c+d}
#' 
#' which simply means fit a glm with \code{y} as the outcome variable and 
#' \code{a}, \code{b}, \code{c} and \code{d} as covariates. 
#' By default all such models also include an intercept (regression constant) term.
#' 
#' Instead, if you need to fit a more complex
#' model, for example:
#' 
#' \eqn{EVENT~1+TID+SEXF*AGE.60}
#'
#' In the above model the outcome variable is \code{EVENT} 
#' and the  covariates 
#' \code{TID} (factor variable with level values between 1 and 6 denoting the period time), 
#' \code{SEXF} (factor variable denoting sex)
#' and \code{AGE.60} (quantitative variable representing age-60 in years). 
#' The term \code{1} forces
#' the model to include an intercept term, in contrast if you use the term \code{0} the 
#' intercept term is removed. The \code{*} symbol  between \code{SEXF} and \code{AGE.60}
#' means fit all possible main effects and interactions for and between those two covariates.
#'  This takes the value 0 in all males \code{0 * AGE.60} 
#'  and in females  \code{1 * AGE.60}. 
#'  This model is in example 1 of  the section \strong{Examples}. In this case the logarithm of 
#'  the survival time is added as an offset (\code{log(survtime)}).
#' 
#' In the \code{family} argument a range of model types can be fitted. This range has recently
#' been extended to include a number of model types that are non-standard but are used
#' relatively widely.
#' 
#' The standard models include:
#'  \describe{
#'    \item{\code{"gaussian"}}{: conventional linear model with normally distributed errors} 
#'    \item{\code{"binomial"}}{: conventional unconditional logistic regression model}
#'    \item{\code{"poisson"}}{: Poisson regression model which is often used in epidemiological
#'     analysis of counts and rates and is also used in survival analysis. The
#'     Piecewise Exponential Regression (PER) model typically provides a close approximation
#'     to the Cox regression model in its main estimates and standard errors.}
#'    \item{\code{"gamma"}}{: a family of models for outcomes characterised by a constant
#'     coefficient of variation, i.e. the variance increases with the square of the expected mean}

#'
#'	The extended range includes:
#'    \item{\code{"quasipoisson"}}{: a model with a Poisson variance function - variance
#'     equals expected mean - but the residual variance which is fixed to be 1.00 in
#'     a standard Poisson model can then take any value. This is achieved by a dispersion parameter
#'     which is estimated during the model fit and if it takes the value K it means
#'	   that the expected variance is K x the expected mean, which implies that all
#'     standard errors will be sqrt(K) times larger than in a standard Poisson model
#'     fitted to the same data. This allows for the extra uncertainty which is associated 
#'     with 'overdispersion' that occurs very commonly with Poisson distributed data,
#'     and typically arises when the count/rate data being modelled occur in blocks
#'	   which exhibit heterogeneity of underlying risk which is not being fully
#'     modelled, either by including the blocks themselves as a factor or by including
#'     covariates for all the determinants that are relevant to that underlying risk. If
#'     there is no overdispersion (K=1) the estimates and standard errors from the
#'     quasipoisson model will be almost identical to those from a standard poisson model.}
#' 
#'    \item{\code{"quasibinomial"}}{: a model with a binomial variance function - if P
#'     is the expected proportion of successes, and N is the number of "trials" (always
#'     1 if analysing binary data which are formally described as having a Bernoulli
#'     distribution (binomial distribution with N=1) the variance function is N*(P)*(1-P).
#'     But the residual variance which is fixed to be 1.00 in
#'     a binomial model can take any value. This is achieved by a dispersion parameter
#'     which is estimated during the model fit (see quasipoisson information above).}}

#' Each class of models has a "canonical link" which represents the link function that
#' maximises the information extraction by the model. The gaussian family uses the
#' \code{identity} link, the poisson family the \code{log} link, the binomial/Bernoulli family the
#' \code{logit} link and the the gamma family the \code{reciprocal} link.
#' 
#' The \code{dataName} argument avoids you having to specify the name of the
#' data frame in front of each covariate in the formula. 
#' For example, if the data frame is called \code{DataFrame} you
#' avoid having to write: \eqn{DataFrame\$y ~ DataFrame\$a + DataFrame\$b + DataFrame\$c + DataFrame\$d}
#' 
#' The \code{checks} argument verifies that the variables in the model are all defined (exist) 
#' on the server-site at every study
#' and that they have the correct characteristics required to fit the model. 
#' It is suggested to make \code{checks} argument TRUE only if an unexplained
#'  problem in the model fit is encountered because the running process takes several minutes.
#'  
#' In \code{maxit} Logistic regression and Poisson regression
#' models can require many iterations, particularly if the starting value of the
#' regression constant is far away from its actual value that the GLM
#' is trying to estimate. In consequence we often set \code{maxit=30}
#' but depending on the nature of the models you wish to fit, you may wish
#' to be alerted much more quickly than this if there is a delay in convergence, 
#' or you may wish to allow more iterations.
#' 
#' 
#' Server functions called: \code{glmSLMADS1}, \code{glmSLMADS2}, \code{glmSLMADS.assign}
#' @param formula an object of class formula describing
#' the model to be fitted. For more information see 
#' \strong{Details}.  
#' @param family identifies the error distribution function to use in
#' the model. 
#' @param offset  a character string specifying the name of a variable to be used as
#' an offset.\code{ds.glmSLMA} does not allow an offset vector to be
#' written directly into the GLM formula.  
#' @param weights a character string specifying the name of a variable containing
#' prior regression
#' weights for the fitting process. \code{ds.glmSLMA} does not allow a weights vector to be

#' If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified

#' @return The serverside aggregate functions \code{glmSLMADS1} and \code{glmSLMADS2} return
#' output to the clientside, while the assign function \code{glmSLMADS.assign} simply writes
#' the glm object to the serverside
#' created by the model fit on a given server as a permanent object on that same server.
#' This is precisely
#' the same as the glm object that is usually created by a call to glm() in native R and it
#' contains all the same elements (see help for glm in native R). Because it is a serverside
#' object, no disclosure blocks apply. However, such disclosure blocks do apply to the information
#' passed to the clientside. In consequence, rather than containing all the components of a
#' standard glm object in native R, the components of the glm object that are returned by
#' \code{ds.glmSLMA} include: a mixture of non-disclosive elements of the glm object
#' reported separately by study included in a list object called \code{output.summary}; and
#' a series of other list objects that represent inferences aggregated across studies.
#' @return the study specific items include: 
#' @return \code{coefficients}: a matrix with 5 columns:
#'    \describe{
#'    \item{First}{: the names of all of the regression parameters (coefficients) in the model} 
#'    \item{second}{: the estimated values} 
#'    \item{third}{: corresponding standard errors of the estimated values} 
#'    \item{fourth}{: the ratio of estimate/standard error} 
#'    \item{fifth}{: the p-value treating that as a standardised normal deviate}

#' in the GLM.
#' @return \code{formula}: model formula, see description of formula as an input parameter (above).
#' @return \code{df.resid}: the residual degrees of freedom around the model.
#' @return \code{deviance.resid}: the residual deviance around the model.
#' @return \code{df.null}: the degrees of freedom around the null model (with just an intercept).
#' @return \code{dev.null}: the deviance around the null model (with just an intercept).
#' @return \code{CorrMatrix}: the correlation matrix of parameter estimates.
#' @return \code{VarCovMatrix}: the variance-covariance matrix of parameter estimates.
#' @return \code{weights}: the name of the vector (if any) holding regression weights.
#' @return \code{offset}: the name of the vector (if any) holding an offset (enters glm with a
#' coefficient of 1.00).
#' @return \code{cov.scaled}: equivalent to \code{VarCovMatrix}.
#' @return \code{cov.unscaled}: equivalent to VarCovMatrix but assuming dispersion (scale)
#' parameter is 1.
#' @return \code{Nmissing}: the number of missing observations in the given study.
#' @return \code{Nvalid}: the number of valid (non-missing) observations in the given study.
#' @return \code{Ntotal}: the total number of observations in the given study 
#'                        (\code{Nvalid} + \code{Nmissing}).
#' @return \code{data}: equivalent to input parameter \code{dataName} (above).
#' @return \code{dispersion}: the estimated dispersion parameter: deviance.resid/df.resid for
#' a gaussian family multiple regression model, 1.00 for logistic and poisson regression.
#' @return \code{call}:  summary of key elements of the call to fit the model.
#' @return \code{na.action}:  chosen method of dealing with missing values. This is 
#' usually, \code{na.action = na.omit} - see help in native R.
#' @return \code{iter}: the number of iterations required to achieve convergence
#' of the glm model in each separate study.
#' @return Once the study-specific output has been returned, \code{ds.glmSLMA}
#' returns a series of lists relating to the aggregated inferences across studies.
#' These include the following:
#' @return \code{num.valid.studies}: the number of studies with valid output
#' included in the combined analysis
#' @return \code{betamatrix.all}: matrix with a row for each regression coefficient
#' and a column for each study reporting the estimated regression coefficients
#' by study. 
#' @return \code{sematrix.all}: matrix with a row for each regression coefficient
#' and a column for each study reporting the standard errors of the estimated
#' regression coefficients by study.

#' and a column for each study reporting the estimated regression coefficients
#' by study but only for studies with valid output (eg not violating disclosure traps) 
#' @return \code{sematrix.all}: matrix with a row for each regression coefficient

#' regression coefficients by study but only for studies with valid output
#' (eg not violating disclosure traps)
#' @return \code{SLMA.pooled.estimates.matrix}: a matrix with a row for each
#' regression coefficient and six columns. The first two columns contain the

#' 3 and 4 contain the estimates and standard errors from random effect meta-analysis
#' under REML and columns 5 and 6 the estimates and standard errors under fixed
#' effect meta-analysis. This matrix is only returned if the
#' argument combine.with.metafor is set to TRUE. Otherwise, users can take
#' the \code{betamatrix.valid} and \code{sematrix.valid} matrices and enter
#' them into their meta-analysis package of choice.
#' @return \code{is.object.created} and \code{validity.check} are standard

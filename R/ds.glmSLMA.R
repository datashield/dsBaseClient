#' @title ds.glmSLMA calling glmSLMADS1, glmSLMADS2
#' @description Fits a generalized linear model (glm) on data from a single or multiple sources
#' with pooled co-analysis across studies being based on study level meta-analysis
#' @details ds.glmSLMA specifies the structure of a generalized linear model (glm)
#' to be fitted separately on each study/data source. The model is first constructed
#' and disclosure checked by glmSLMADS1. This aggregate function then returns its
#' output to ds.glmSLMA which processes the information and uses it in a call to
#' the second aggregate function glmSLMADS2. This call specifies and fits
#' the required glm in each data source.
#' Unlike glmDS2 (called by the more commonly used generalized linear modelling
#' client-side function ds.glm) the requested model is then fitted to completion
#' on the data in each study rather than iteration by iteration on all studies
#' combined. At the end of this SLMA fitting process
#' glmSLMADS2 returns study-specific parameter estimates
#' and standard errors to the client. These can then be pooled using random
#' effects (or fixed effects) meta-analysis - eg using the metafor package.
#' This mode of model fitting may
#' reasonably be called study level meta-analysis (SLMA) although the analysis
#' is based on estimates and standard errors derived from direct analysis of
#' the individual level data in each study rather than from published study
#' summaries (as is often the case with SLMA of clinical trials etc).
#' Furthermore, unlike common approaches to study-level meta-analysis
#' adopted by large multi-study research consortia (eg in the combined analysis
#' of identical genomic markers across multiple studies), the parallel
#' analyses (in every study) under ds.glmSLMA are
#' controlled entirely from one client. This avoids the time-consuming
#' need to ask each study to run its own analyses and the consequent
#' necessity to request additional work from individual studies if
#' the modelling is to be extended to include analyses not subsumed
#' in the original analytic plan. Additional analyses of this nature
#' may, for example, include analyses based on interactions between covariates
#' identified as having significant main effects in the original analysis.
#' From a mathematical perspective, the SLMA approach (using ds.glmSLMA)
#' differs fundamentally from the usual approach using ds.glm
#' in that the latter is mathematically equivalent
#' to placing all individual-level data from all sources in
#' one central warehouse and analysing those data as one combined dataset using the
#' conventional glm() function in R. However, although this
#' may sound to be preferable under all circumstances, the SLMA approach
#' actually offers key inferential advantages when there is marked heterogeneity
#' between sources that cannot simply be corrected with fixed effects each reflecting a study
#' or centre-effect. In particular, fixed effects cannot simply be used in this way when there
#' there is heterogeneity in the effect that is of scientific interest.
#' @param formula Denotes an object of class formula which is a character string describing
#' the model to be fitted. Most shortcut notation for formulas allowed under R's standard glm()
#' function is also allowed by ds.glmSLMA. Many glms can
#' be fitted very simply using a formula such as:
#' "y~a+b+c+d" which simply means fit a glm with y as the outcome variable with a, b, c and d as
#' covariates. By default all such models also include an intercept (regression constant) term.
#' If all you need to fit are straightforward models such as these, you do not need to read the
#' remainder of this information about "formula". But if you need to fit a more complex
#' model in a customised way, the following text gives a few additional pointers:
#' As an example, the formula: "EVENT~1+TID+SEXF*AGE.60" denotes fit a glm with the
#' variable "EVENT" as its
#' outcome with covariates TID (in this case a 6 level factor [categorical] variable denoting
#' "time period" with values between 1 and 6), SEXF (also a factor variable denoting sex
#' and AGE.60 (a quantitative variable representing age-60 in years). The term "1" forces
#' the model to include an intercept term which it would also have done by default (see above)
#' but using "1" may usefully be contrasted with using "0" (as explained below), which removes
#' the intercept term. The "*" between SEXF and AGE.60
#' means fit all possible main effects and interactions for and between those two covariates.
#' As SEXF is a factor this is equivalent to writing SEXF+AGE.60+SEXF1:AGE.60 (the
#' last element being the simple interaction term representing the product
#' of SEXF level 1 [in this case female] and AGE.60). This takes the value 0 in all males
#' (0 * AGE.60), and the same value as AGE.60 (1 * AGE.60) in females.
#' If the formula had instead been written as:
#' "EVENT~0+TID+SEXF*AGE.60" the 0 would mean do NOT fit
#' an intercept term and, because TID happens to be a six level factor this would mean
#' that the first six model parameters which were originally intercept+TID2+TID3+TID4+TID5+TID6
#' using the first formula will now become TID1+TID2+TID3+TID4+TID5+TID6.
#' This is mathematically the same model, but conveniently, it means
#' that the effect of each
#' time period may now be estimated directly. For example, the effect of time
#' period 3 is now obtained directly as the coefficient for TID3
#' rather than the sum of the coefficients for the intercept and TID3
#' which was the case using the original formula.
#' @param family This argument identifies the error distribution function to use in
#' the model. At present
#' ds.glm has been written to fit family="gaussian" (i.e. a
#' conventional linear model with normally distributed errors), family="binomial"
#' (i.e. a conventional
#' unconditional logistic regression model), and family = "poisson" (i.e. a
#' Poisson regression model - of which perhaps the most commonly used application
#' is for survival analysis
#' using Piecewise Exponential Regression (PER) which
#' typically closely approximates Cox regression in its
#' main estimates and standard
#' errors. At present the gaussian family is automatically coupled with
#' an 'identity' link function, the binomial family with a
#' 'logistic' link function and the poisson family with a 'log' link function. For the majority of
#' applications typically
#' encountered in epidemiology and medical statistics, one  these three classes of
#' models will typically be what you need. However, if a particular user
#' wishes us to implement an alternative family
#' (e.g. 'gamma') or an alternative family/link combination (e.g. binomial with
#' probit) we can discuss how best to meet that request: it will almost certainly be possible,
#' but we may seek a small amount of funding or practical in-kind support from
#' the user in order to ensure that it can be carried outin a timely manner
#' @param offset  A character string specifying the name of a variable to be used as
#' an offset. An offset is a component of a glm which may be viewed as a covariate
#' with a known coefficient of 1.00 and so the coefficient does not need to be
#' estimated by the model. As an example, an offset is needed to fit a piecewise
#' exponential regression model. Unlike the standard glm() function in
#' native R, ds.glmSLMA() only allows an offset
#' to be set using the <offset> argument, it CANNOT be included directly in the
#' formula via notation
#' such as  "y~a+b+c+d+offset(offset.vector.name)". So in ds.glmSLMA this model
#' must be specified as: formula="y~a+b+c+d", ..., offset="offset.vector.name"
#' and ds.glmSLMA then incorporates
#' it appropriately into the formula itself.
#' @param weights A character string specifying the name of a variable containing
#' prior regression
#' weights for the fitting process. Like offset, ds.glmSLMA does not allow a weights vector to be
#' written directly into the glm formula.
#' @param dataName A character string specifying the name of an (optional) dataframe that contains
#' all of the variables in the glm formula. This avoids you having to specify the name of the
#' dataframe in front of each covariate in the formula e.g. if the dataframe is
#' called "DataFrame" you
#' avoid having to write: "DataFrame$y~DataFrame$a+DataFrame$b+DataFrame$c+DataFrame$d"
#' Processing stops if a non existing data frame is indicated.
#' @param checks This argument is a boolean. If TRUE ds.glmSLMA then undertakes a series
#' of checks of
#' the structural integrity of the model that can take several minutes. Specifically
#' it verifies that the
#' variables in the model are all defined (exist) on the server site at every study
#' and that they have the correct characteristics required to fit a GLM. The default
#' value is FALSE
#  because the checks markedly increase fitting time
#' and so it is suggested that the argument <checks> is only made TRUE
#' if an unexplained problem in the model fit is encountered.
#' @param maxit A numeric scalar denoting the maximum number of iterations that
#' are permitted
#' before ds.glm declares that the model has failed to converge. Logistic regression
#' and Poisson regression
#' models can require many iterations, particularly if the starting value of the
#' regression constant is
#' far away from its actual value that the glm is trying to estimate. In consequence
#' we choose to set
#' maxit=30 - but depending on the nature of the models you wish to fit, you may wish
#' to be alerted
#' more quickly than this if there is a delay in convergence, or you may wish to
#' allow MORE iterations.
#' @param combine.with.metafor This argument is Boolean. If TRUE (the default) the
#' estimates and standard errors for each regression coefficient are pooled across
#' studies using random effects meta-analysis under maximum likelihood (ML),
#' restricted maximum likelihood (REML), or fixed effects meta-analysis (FE).
#' @param datasources a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
#' the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.
#' @return Many of the elements of the output list returned by ds.glmSLMA from
#' each study separately are precisely
#' equivalent to those returned by the glm() function in native R. However,
#' potentially disclosive elements
#' such as individual-level residuals and linear predictor values are blocked.
#' The return results from each separate study appear first in the return list with
#' the full set of results from each study presented in a block and the
#' blocks listed in the order in which the studies appear in <datasources>.
#' As regards the elements within each study the most important
#' elements are included last in the return list because they then appear at the
#' bottom of a simple print out of the return object. In reverse order, these
#' key elements are listed below. In addition to the elements reflecting the
#' primary results of the analysis, ds.glmSLMA also returns a range of error
#' messages if the model fails indicating why failure may have occurred and
#' in particular detailing any disclosure traps that may have been
#' @return coefficients:- a matrix in which the first column contains the names of
#' all of the regression parameters (coefficients) in the model, the second column
#' contains the estimated values of the coefficients (called estimates),
#' the third the corresponding standard errors,
#' the fourth the ratio corresponding to the value of each estimate divided by its
#' standard error and the fifth the p-value
#' treating that ratio as a standardised normal deviate (a simple Wald test).
#' @return family:- indicates the error distribution and link function used
#' in the glm
#' @return formula:- see description of formula as an input parameter (above)
#' @return df.resid:- the residual degrees of freedom around the model
#' @return deviance.resid:- the residual deviance around the model
#' @return df.null:- the degrees of freedom around the null model (with just an intercept)
#' @return dev.null:- the deviance around the null model (with just an intercept)
#' @return CorrMatrix:- the correlation matrix of parameter estimates
#' @return VarCovMatrix:- the variance covariance matrix of parameter estimates
#' @return weights:- the vector (if any) holding regression weights
#' @return offset:- the vector (if any) holding an offset (enters glm with a
#' coefficient of 1.00)
#' @return cov.scaled:- equivalent to VarCovMatrix
#' @return cov.unscaled:- equivalent to VarCovMatrix but assuming dispersion (scale)
#' parameter is 1
#' @return Nmissing:- the number of missing observations in the given study
#' @return Nvalid:- the number of valid (non-missing) observations in the given study
#' @return Ntotal:- the total number of observations in the given study (Nvalid+Nmissing)
#' @return data:- - equivalent to input parameter dataName (above)
#' @return dispersion:- - the estimated dispersion parameter: deviance.resid/df.resid for
#' a gaussian family multiple regression model, 1.00 for logistic and poisson regression
#' @return call:- - summary of key elements of the call to fit the model
#' @return na.action:- - chosen method of dealing with NAs. Usually, na.action=na.omit
#' indicating any individual (or more strictly any "observational unit")
#' that has any data missing that are needed for the model is
#' exluded from the fit, even if all the rest of the required data are present.
#' These required data include: the outcome variable, covariates,
#' or any values in a regression weight vector or offset vector. As a
#' side effect of this, when you include additional covariates in model
#' you may exclude extra individuals from the analysis
#' and this can seriously distort inferential tests based on assuming models are
#' nested (eg likelihood ratio tests).
#' @return iter:- the number of iterations required to achieve convergence
#' file for the glm() function in native R.
#' @return input.beta.matrix.for.SLMA:- a matrix containing the vector of coefficient
#' estimates from each study. In combination with the corresponding standard errors
#' (see input.se.matrix.for.SLMA) these can be imported directly into a study level
#' meta-analysis (SLMA) package such as metafor to generate estimates pooled via SLMA
#' @return input.se.matrix.for.SLMA:- a matrix containing the vector of standard error
#' estimates for coefficients from each study. In combination with the coefficients
#' (see input.beta.matrix.for.SLMA) these can be imported directly into a study level
#' meta-analysis (SLMA) package such as metafor to generate estimates pooled via SLMA
#' @return SLMA.pooled.estimates:- if the argument <combine.with.metafor> = TRUE,
#' ds.glmSLMA also returns a matrix containing pooled estimates for each
#' regression coefficient across all studies with pooling under SLMA via
#' random effects meta-analysis under maximum likelihood (ML), restricted maximum
#' likelihood (REML) or via fixed effects meta-analysis (FE)
#' @return there are a small number of more esoteric items of information returned
#' by ds.glmSLMA. Additional information about these can be found in the help

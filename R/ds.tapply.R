#' @title ds.tapply calling tapplyDS
#' @description Apply one of a selected range of functions to summarize an
#' outcome variable over one or more indexing factors and write the resultant
#' summary to the clientside
#' @details A clientside function calling an aggregate serverside function that uses
#' the native R function tapply() to apply one of
#' a selected range of functions to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty)
#' group of values given by each unique combination of a series of indexing factors. The native R
#' {tapply} function is very flexible and the range of allowable summarizing functions
#' is much more restrictive for the DataSHIELD ds.tapply function. This is to protect
#' against disclosure risk. At present the allowable functions are: N/length (the number
#' of (non-missing) observations in the group defined by each combination of indexing
#' factors; mean; SD (standard deviation); sum; quantile (with quantile probabilities set at
#' c(0.05,0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.33,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.67,0.7,0.75,0.8,0.9,0.95). Should other functions
#' be required in the future then, provided they are non-disclosive, the DataSHIELD development
#' team could work on them if requested. As an aggregate function {ds.tapply} returns the
#' summarized values to the clientside. In order to protect against disclosure the
#' number of observations in each summarizing group in each source is calculated
#' and if any of these fall below the value of nfilter.tab (the minimum allowable non-zero count
#' in a contingency table) the tapply analysis of that source will return only an error message.
#' The value of nfilter.tab is can be set and modified only by the data custodian. If an
#' analytic team wish the value to be reduced (e.g. to 1 which will allow any output
#' from tapply to be returned) this needs to formally be discussed and agreed
#' with the data custodian. If the reason for the tapply analysis is, for example, to break
#' a dataset down into a small number of values for each individual and then to flag up
#' which individuals have got at least one positive value for a binary outcome variable, then
#' that flagging does not have to be overtly returned to the clientside. Rather, it can be
#' written as a vector to the serverside at each source (which, like any other serverside
#' object, cannot then be seen, abstracted or copied). This can be done using ds.tapply.assign
#' which calls an assign function {tapplyDS.assign} which acts just like the aggregate
#' function {tapplyDS} but it writes the results as a newobj to the serverside and does
#' not test the number of observations in each group against nfilter.tab. The native R
#' tapply function has optional arguments such as na.rm=TRUE for FUN = mean which will
#' exclude any NAs from the outcome variable to be summarized. However, in order to keep
#' DataSHIELD's {ds.tapply} and {ds.tapply.assign} functions straightforward, the
#' serverside functions {tapplyDS} and {tapplyDS.assign} both start by stripping
#' any observations which have missing (NA) values in either the outcome variable or in
#' any one of the indexing factors. In consequence, the resultant analyses are always based
#' on complete.cases.
#' @param X.name, the name of the variable to be summarized. The user must set the name as a
#' character string in inverted commas. For example: X.name="var.name"
#' @param INDEX.names, the name of a single factor or a vector of names of factors to
#' index the variable to be summarized. Each name must be specified in inverted commas.
#' For example: INDEX.names="factor.name" or
#' INDEX.names=c("factor1.name", "factor2.name", "factor3.name"). The native R tapply function
#' can coerce non-factor vectors into factors. However, this does not always work when
#' using the DataSHIELD ds.tapply/ds.tapply.assign functions so if you are concerned that
#' an indexing vector is not being treated correctly as a factor,
#' please first declare it explicitly as a factor using {ds.asFactor}
#' @param FUN.name, the name of one of the allowable summarizing functions to be applied
#' specified in inverted commas. The present version of the
#' function allows the user to choose one of five summarizing functions. These are
#' "N" (or "length"), "mean","sd", "sum", or "quantile". For more information see Details.
#' @param datasources a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
#' the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.
#' @return an array of the summarized values created by the tapplyDS function. This array
#' is returned to the clientside. It has the same number of dimensions as INDEX.

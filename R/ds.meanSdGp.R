#' @title  Computes the mean and standard deviation across groups defined by one factor
#' @description This function calculates the mean and SD of a continuous variable for each class of
#' a single factor.
#' @details This function calculates the mean, standard deviation (SD), N (number of observations)
#' and the standard error of the mean (SEM) of a continuous variable broken down into subgroups
#' defined by a single factor. It also reports the total number of observations (=Ntotal), the
#' total number of valid observations, i.e. non-missing observations = observations where neither
#' the continuous variable nor the factor is misssing, (Nvalid) and the total number of missing
#' observations (Nmissing). Nvalid=Ntotal-Nmissing and all three quantities represent the sum
#' across all groups and all studies. If any one subgroup consists of between 1 and "nfilter"
#' observations, the function simply reports that fact and suggests that you use a different
#' grouping variable. As in other functions such as ds.table1D, the value of nfilter can be chosen
#' by the data custodian when each data repository server is originally set up. By default it is set to 5.
#' There are IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES between ds.meanSdGp compared to the function ds.meanByClass.
#'(A) ds.meanSdGp does not actually subset the data it simply calculates the required statistics
#' and reports them. This means you cannot use this function if you wish to physically break the
#' data into subsets. On the other hand, it makes the function very much faster than ds.meanByClass
#' if you do not need to create physical subsets. (B) ds.meanByClass allows you to specify up to
#' three categorising factors, but ds.meanSdGp only allows one. However, this is not a serious
#' problem. If you have two factors (e.g. sex with two levels [0 and 1] and BMI.categorical with
#' three levels [1,2,3]) you simply need to create a new factor that combines the two together in a
#' way that gives each combination of levels a different value in the new factor. So, in the
#' example given, the calculation newfactor=(3*sex)+BMI gives you six values: sex=0, BMI=1,
#' newfactor=1; sex=0, BMI=2, newfactor=2; sex=0, BMI=3, newfactor=3; sex=1, BMI=1, newfactor=4;
#  sex=1, BMI=2, newfactor=5; sex=1, BMI=3, newfactor=6. This calculation can be done with a single
#' ds.assign command and you then use newfactor as the single categorising factor. (C) At present,
#' ds.meanByClass calculates the sample size in each group to mean the TOTAL sample size (i.e. it
#' includes all observations in each group regardless whether or not they include missing values
#' for the continuous variable or the factor). The calculation of sample size in each group by
#' ds.meanSdGp always reports the number of observations that are non-missing both for the
#' continuous variable and the factor. This makes sense - in the case of ds.meanByClass, the total
#' size of the physical subsets was important, but when it comes down only to ds.meanSdGp which
#' undertakes analysis without physical subsetting,  it is only the observations with non-missing
#' values in both variables that contribute to the calculation of means and SDs within each group
#' and so it is logical to consider those counts as primary. The only reference ds.meanSdGp makes
#' to missing counts is in the reporting of Ntotal and Nmissing overall (ie not broken down by
#' group). For the future, we plan to extend ds.meanByClass to report both total and non-missing
#' counts in subgroups.
#' @param x This must be named as a character string (e.g. "AGE"). It must denote a continuous
#' variable of class numeric.
#' @param y This must be named as a character string (e.g. "sex"). It must denote a categorical
#' variable of class factor.
#' @param type This must be specified as a character string ("combine", "split" or "both"). If
#' "combine" the results for each group are reported combined over all studies. If "split" the
#' table of means by group (for example) has a separate column for each study. If "both" the tables
#' each have an additional column reporting the sum across all studies in each group in addition to
#' the columns (produced by "split") for each study alone. This parameter defaults to "both" unless
#' "combine" or "split" are specified.
#' @param do.checks This parameter defaults to FALSE. It determines whether administrative checks
#' are undertaken to ensure that the input objects are defined in all studies, and that the
#' variables are of equivalent class in each study. By defaulting the checks to FALSE, we save
#' time, and if you hit a problem that you cannot understand you can reset do.checks to TRUE and
#' make sure that the input objects are correctly defined in all studies.
#' @param datasources a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
#' the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.
#' @return If type = "combine" the function returns a list consisting of a four tables denoting:
#' mean by group; standard deviation (SD) by group; number of non-missing observations (Nvalid) by
#' group; and standard error of the mean (SEM) by group. All of these are COMBINED ACROSS STUDIES.
#' For information, SEM = SD/sqrt(Nvalid). These are all returned in list format with names:
#' Mean_gp, StDev_gp, Nvalid_gp and SEM_gp. If you need to use them in their original class (e.g.
#' matrix), you need to use the conventional R function unlist() to convert them back to their
#' original form. The output list also includes: Total_Nvalid (the total number of valid
#' [non-missing] observations across all groups in all studies; Total_Nmissing (the total number of
#' observations with either or both x and y missing); and Total_Ntotal (the total number of
#' observations [with data missing or not]). If type ="split", the mean, SD, Nvalid and SEM are
#' reported by group and by study. The first four elements of the returned output list are
#' therefore: Mean_gp_study; StDev_gp_study; Nvalid_gp_study; and SEM_gp_study. If there are three
#' studies and we are breaking things down by five groups in each study, each of the first four
#' list elements consists of a table with five rows (one for each group) and three columns (one for
#' each study). The returned output also includes Total_Nvalid, Total_Nmissing and Total_Ntotal as
#' before. If type = "both" the output is precisely the same as with type="split" and each of its
#' components has the same name, but each table (e.g. Mean_gp_study) will now have an extra column
#' on the right had side (so a fourth column in the example above) which contains the appropriate
#' combined value in each group across all studies together. In other words, the four columns
#' replicate the results obtained when type = "combine". CRUCIALLY, IF ONE OR MORE OF THE GROUPS IN
#' ANY OF THE STUDIES CONTAINS BETWEEN 1 and nfilter OBSERVATIONS, the returned output list will
#' ONLY include the warning: [1] "At least 1 cell count is 1-nfilter, please regroup".

#' @title Represents follow-up in multiple states on multiple time scales 
#' @description This function takes a data frame containing survival data and expands it by converting records at
#' the level of individual subjects (survival time, censoring status, IDs and other variables) into
#' multiple records over a series of pre-defined time intervals.
#' 
#' 
#' @details The function \code{ds.lexis} splits the survival interval time of subjects into pre-specified
#' sub-intervals that are each assumed to encompass a constant base-line hazard which means a
#' constant instantaneous risk of death). In the expanded dataset a row is included for every
#' interval in which a given individual is followed - regardless of how short or long that period may
#' be. Each row includes:\cr
#' (1) \strong{CENSOR}: a variable indicating failure status for a particular
#' interval in that interval also known as censoring status. 
#' This variable can take two values: \strong{1} representing that the patient
#' has died, relapsed or developed a
#' disease. \strong{0} representing the lost-to-follow-up 
#' or passed right through the interval without failing. \cr
#' (2) \strong{SURVTIME} an exposure-time variable indicating the duration of exposure-to-risk-of-failure
#' the corresponding individual experienced in that interval before he/she failed or was censored.
#' 
#' To illustrate, an individual who survives through 5 such intervals and then dies/fails in the
#' 6th interval will be allocated a 0 value for the failure status/censoring variable in the first
#' five intervals and a 1 value in the 6th, while the exposure-time variable will be equal to the
#' total length of the relevant interval in each of the first five intervals, and the additional
#' length of time they survived in the sixth interval before they failed or were censored. If they
#' survive through the first interval and they are censored in the second interval, the
#' failure-status variable will take the value 0 in both intervals.\cr
#' (3) \strong{UID.expanded} the expanded data set also
#' includes a unique ID in a form such as 77.13 which identifies that row of the
#' dataset as relating to the 77th individual in the input data set and his/her experience 
#' (exposure-time and failure status)in the
#' 14th interval. Note that \code{.N} indicates the \code{(N+1)}th interval because 
#' interval 1 has no suffix.\cr
#' (4) \strong{IDSEQ} the first part of \code{UID.expanded} (before the \code{'.'}). 
#' The value of this
#' variable is repeated in every row to which the corresponding individual contributes data (i.e.
#' to every row corresponding to an interval in which that individual was followed).\cr
#' (5) The expanded dataset contains any other variables about each individual that the user
#' would like to  carry forward to a survival analysis based on the expanded data. Typically,
#' this will include the original ID as specified to the data repository, the total survival time (equivalent to
#' the sum of the exposure times across all intervals) and the ultimate failure-status in the final
#' interval to which they were exposed.  The value of each of these variables is also repeated in
#' every row corresponding to an interval in which that individual was followed. 
#' 
#' In \code{intervalWidth} argument if the total sum of the duration across all intervals is less 
#' than the maximum follow-up of any individual in
#' any contributing study, a final interval will be added by \code{ds.lexis} extending from the end of the
#' last interval specified to the maximum follow-up time. If a single numeric value is specified
#' rather than a vector, \code{ds.lexis} will keep adding intervals of the length specified until the
#' maximum follow-up time in any single study is exceeded. This argument is subject to
#' disclosure checks. 
#' 
#' The \code{idCol} argument must be a numeric or character. Note that when a particular variable is
#' identified as being the main ID to the data repository when the data are first transferred 
#' to the data repository (i.e. before
#' DataSHIELD is used), that ID often ends up being of class character and will then be sorted in
#' alphabetic order (treating each digit as a character) rather than numeric. 
#' For example, containing the sequential IDs 1-1000, the order of the IDs will be:\cr
#' 1,10,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,11 ...\cr
#' In an alphabetic listing: NOT to the expected order:\cr
#' 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 ...\cr
#' 
#' This alphabetic order or the ID listing will then carry forward to the
#' expanded dataset. But the nature and order of the original ID 
#' variable held in \code{idCol} doesn't
#' matter to \code{ds.lexis}. Provided every individual appears only once 
#' in the original data set (before expansion) the order does not matter because 
#' \code{ds.lexis} works on its unique numeric vector
#' that is allocated from \code{1:M} (where there are \code{M} individuals) 
#' in whatever order they appear in the original dataset. 
#' 
#' in \code{entryCol} argument rather than using a total survival time variable to identify the
#' intervals to which any given individual is exposed, \code{ds.lexis} 
#' requires an initial entry time and a final exit time. If the data you wish to expand 
#' contain only a total survival time variable
#' and every individual starts follow-up at time 0, the entry times should all
#' be specified as zero, and the exit times as the total survival time. 
#' So, \code{entryCol} should either be the name of the column 
#' holding the entry time of each individual or else if no \code{entryCol} is
#' specified it will be defaulted to zero anyway and put into a variable 
#' called \code{starttime} in the expanded data set.
#' 
#' In \code{exitCol} argument, if the entry times (\code{entryCol}) are set, 
#' or defaulted, to zero, the \code{exitCol} variable should contain the total survival times.
#' 
#' If \code{variables} argument is not set (is
#' null) but the \code{data} argument is set, the expanded data 
#' set will contain all variables in the data frame identified by the \code{data} argument. 
#' If neither the \code{data} or 
#' \code{variables} arguments are set, the expanded data set will only include the ID, 
#' exposure time and failure/censoring status
#' variables which may still be useful for plotting survival data once these become available.
#' 
#' This function is particularly meant to be used in preparing data for a piecewise
#' regression analysis (PAR). Although the time intervals have to be pre-specified and are
#' arbitrary, even a vaguely reasonable set of time intervals will give results very similar to a
#' Cox regression analysis. The key issue is to choose survival intervals such that the baseline
#' hazard (risk of death/disease/failure) within each interval is reasonably constant while the
#' baseline hazard can vary freely between intervals. Even if the choice of intervals is very poor
#' the ultimate results are typically qualitatively similar to Cox regression. Increasing the
#' number of intervals will inevitably improve the approximation to the true baseline hazard, but
#' the addition of many more unnecessary time intervals slows the analysis and can become disclosive
#' and yet will not improve the fit of the model. 
#' 
#' If the number of failures in one or more 
#' periods in a given study is less than the specified disclosure filter determining minimum
#' acceptable cell size in a table (\code{nfilter.tab}) 
#' then the expanded data frame is not created in that study, and a study-side message 
#' to this effect is made available in that study via \code{ds.message()} function.
